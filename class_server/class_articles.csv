Cruz said, “The people of Indiana have good sense. The people of Indiana have good judgment. The people of Indiana I don’t believe are simply going to say Manhattan has spoken. Therefore, we must get behind a New York liberal. I don’t believe the people of Indiana want to do that. And I think anyone who wants to be elected president owes it to the voters to do what I’m doing here. Heidi and I, we are barnstorming the state. We are on a bus tour traveling the state to look voters in the eyes, to answer their questions, to show the humility to subject yourself to the scrutiny of Hoosiers. Donald Trump doesn’t like to do that. Donald Trump likes to parachute in like Mick Jagger show up at a football stadium, give some performance and then leave. Well, this country isn’t a reality show. And if Donald Trump thinks he’s too good to answer questions from the men and women of Indiana, that conveys something. He continued, “It’s now been 48 days since the last Republican debate. 48 days. the Democrats have debated. Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have both demonstrated more humility than Donald Trump in that they have subjected themselves to the scrutiny of the voters.

Has anyone noticed that even though the networks stand to lose millions of dollars by not having a debate, that the news is utterly silent on there being no debates? Have you noticed that, that FOX News, CNN, NBC, ABC, CBS, they stand to make millions and yet they do not say a word about the absence of debates. It almost makes you think the network executives are happy with Donald Trump being the   and they know that in a debate he doesn’t have any answers to how you bring jobs back to America.

","Farmville, Va.  —   On Tuesday night, Mike Pence managed to do what Donald Trump could not. In his first and only debate against Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine, the Indiana governor delivered a calm and   performance. Where Trump, in his first debate last week, came off as maniacal, Pence was cool and collected. Where Trump found himself insulting a former beauty queen and Rosie O’Donnell, Pence stuck to the script. Where Trump veered onto tangents, missing easy opportunities to attack Clinton, Pence did the opposite, turning most questions into opportunities to hit the Democratic ticket.  The result was a performance that left Republican surrogates praising Pence as a better justification for Trump’s candidacy than Trump himself  —   proof that the nominee makes good decisions and surrounds himself with qualified people. Clinton surrogates were quick to point out that Tuesday’s showdown may have done little to help either side. Many Republicans have been vocal about the fact that they feel far more comfortable with Pence than with Trump, and tonight only reinforced that feeling. But both Pence and Kaine found themselves submerged in a sloppy and unsavory affair, from Kaine’s constant interjections to Pence’s untruthful defenses of Trump to moderator Elaine Quijano’s shaky refereeing. The tone was set with the second question of the night, when Quijano asked Kaine why the majority of Americans believe Clinton is untrustworthy. After briefly discussing Clinton’s “passion” for working with children, Kaine pivoted to highlight Trump’s infamous comment about illegal Mexican immigrants being “rapists” and “murderers,” before concluding that he “can’t imagine” how Pence would defend such remarks. Pence responded first by saying that Clinton had overseen a failed foreign policy that had emboldened adversaries such as Russia. He was then interrupted by Kaine, who took the opportunity to argue that the GOP ticket “loves” Vladimir Putin. When Pence continued on to tout his running mate’s “business acumen,” Kaine interrupted to point out that Trump paid few taxes and lost nearly $1 billion in 1995. When Pence turned to the Clinton Foundation, Kaine began talking over him. Rinse and repeat. There were no blockbuster,    moments to remember. But perhaps the most lasting impression from the night will be of a contrast in style. Kaine, as Clinton spokeswoman Karen Finney said after the debate, did what   nominees are expected to do: “I don’t like the phrase ‘attack dog,’ but your job is to stand up for your running mate. ” It was a role in which the Virginian, known for his    affability, appeared to be uncomfortable and rather ineffective. “I thought Tim Kaine sounded a little silly and frankly sounded like he needed maybe three fewer cups of coffee, cause he sounded a little too animated there, a little bit too like a yapping puppy dog at someone’s ankle. Someone needs to calm him down,” said Representative Jeb Hensarling, a friend of Pence’s who was in the spin room for him. Meanwhile, Pence, the onetime radio host, was measured and steady throughout, shaking his head and delivering his attacks with a smile on his face. He   jabbed Kaine for his mechanically rehearsed   and   dumps. Clinton campaign surrogates, spinning after the debate, made only   attempts to argue that their man had won. Instead, they said, Pence had failed to do enough to change the narrative that emerged from Trump’s problematic first debate. “I think the VP debate matters in the sense that if you are losing, like Trump and Pence did, you need to change the trajectory of the campaign by some means, and they weren’t able to do that. So I think that’s a victory for the Clinton team,” said Representative Ruben Gallego, who was in the spin room as a surrogate for Kaine. That is not to say Kaine was without strong moments. His greatest success was to doggedly prosecute Trump’s record of offending various groups  —   from women to veterans to minorities  —   and aggressively goad Pence into defending them. “I can’t imagine how you defend your running mate’s position,” he repeatedly told Pence. Kaine’s persistence paid off on several occasions, most notably when Pence denied that both he and Trump had said Putin is a better leader than President Obama. But Pence’s strategy, for the most part, was to deflect such attacks rather than tackle them head on. Quite often, Pence seemed to be blissfully campaigning in an alternate universe from the one Trump inhabits. He repeatedly described the   campaign as “” a laughable remark coming from someone whose running mate has made an art of the insult over the course of this campaign. Other times, he simply ignored Kaine’s calls to defend Trump. Much had been made of the fact that this would be the first debate since the New York Times published a year of Trump’s tax returns, making Pence the first line of defense against a story that could be very bad for the Republican nominee. Pence said some kind words about his running mate as a businessman who complied with the tax code. And then he declined to address the subject again. “Why won’t he release his tax returns?” Kaine blurted out at one point. “Well, we’re answering a question about the business thing,” Pence replied calmly, brushing off the question. When Kaine brought up Gonzalo Curiel, a   federal judge from Pence’s home state of Indiana whom Trump deemed too biased to rule in a lawsuit against Trump University because of his Mexican heritage, Pence simply ignored the remark and moved on. More Mike Pence Get Ready for the Pillorying of PenceMr. Vice President: Please Help the President Get His Act TogetherNotre Dame Students Feel ‘Unsafe’ about Mike Pence SpeakingPence’s strategy of moving the conversation to safer ground earned him style points and credit for staying on message, but it also opened him up to easy attacks from Clinton’s camp. “Why is it that Mike Pence can’t defend his own running mate? Maybe he doesn’t know who his own running mate is,” suggested Clinton spokeswoman Karen Finney following the debate. It was evident in the spin room that Pence had reassured Republicans who remain    with the party’s nominee. But for the Indiana governor, who harbors presidential ambitions of his own, Trump could prove somewhat problematic down the road. At one point, he declared that he “could not be more proud to stand with Donald Trump. ” Should Hillary Clinton win in November, Pence will undoubtedly find himself in the top tier of prospective Republican candidates to challenge her four years from now, and that is a comment that may well come back to haunt him.,",0,0,0,0,0,0,2

","In the Trump administration, the buck apparently stops anywhere but the Oval Office. President Trump on Tuesday blamed the military for   a Navy SEAL who was killed in  .  the    repeatedly said “they”  —   meaning the military  —   were at fault for the death of Owens, whose dad, Bill, refused to appear with Trump when his son’s body was returned to the US. “This was a mission that was started before I got here. This was something they wanted to do,” Trump said. “They came to me, they explained what they wanted to do. The generals  —   who are very respected, my generals are the most respected that we’ve had in many decades, I believe. And they lost Ryan,” he added. “This was something that they were looking at for a long time doing, and according to [Defense Secretary Jim] Mattis, it was a very successful mission. They got tremendous amounts of information. ” Trump said he could understand why Bill Owens  —      —   would not want to meet with him. “I can understand people saying that. I’d feel  —   ‘What’s worse?’ There’s nothing worse,” he added. Owens had blasted Trump for authorizing the raid barely a week into his presidency. “Why at this time did there have to be this stupid mission when it wasn’t even barely a week into his administration,” he told the Miami Herald. While Trump and White House spokesman Sean Spicer have repeatedly called the operation a roaring success, US officials   on Monday that  . In addition to Owens, 25 civilians, including women and children, were killed, as were numerous terrorists. Four other Americans were wounded and a $70 million Bell transport helicopter was lost. Sen. John McCain ( .) had also questioned whether the mission was a success  —   prompting a predictably vituperative   from the president. “Sen. McCain should not be talking about the success or failure of a mission to the media. Only emboldens the enemy! He’s been losing so long he doesn’t know how to win anymore, just look at the mess our country is in  —   bogged down in conflict all over the place. Our hero Ryan died on a winning mission (according to General Mattis) not a ‘failure.’ Time for the U. S. to get smart and start winning again!” Trump crowed in a series of three   tweets on Feb. 9. Presidents historically accept responsibility for their decisions, with President Harry Truman famously plopping a sign reading “The Buck Stops Here” on his desk in the Oval Office. Presidents John Kennedy, Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, George W. Bush and Barack Obama all adhered to that dictate when crises struck. “I’m the president. And I’m always responsible,” Obama said after an attack on a US consulate in Benghazi in which four Americans, including the US ambassador, were murdered.",0,0,0,0,0,0,4

"," Maine voters are going to caucus sites Sunday in large numbers, as predicted, to choose between Democratic presidential candidates Sen. Bernie Sanders and   Hillary Clinton, after they split wins in earlier voting this weekend. Long lines are forming at some of the roughly 400 sites across the state, where Clinton and the Vermont senator will compete for 25 delegates. On Saturday, Sanders won the Nebraska and Kansas caucuses, while Clinton took the bigger Louisiana primary, increasing her delegate count over Sanders 1, 121 to 481. That includes superdelegates    members of Congress, governors and party officials who can support the candidate of their choice. It takes 2, 383 delegates to win the nomination. Limited polling is available in Maine, where the polls will close at about the time Clinton and Sanders take part in a live CNN debate in Michigan. To be sure, both are already focusing on Michigan, which in Tuesday’s primary also has 25 Democratic delegates up for grabs. Clinton has a   lead in the state, according to a RealClearPolitics poll average.   The economy will likely be a major topic in the debate in Flint, Mich.    a city in tough shape long before residents learned their drinking water was tainted with lead. Clinton will likely argue that only she has a ”credible strategy” for raising wages, while Sanders will presumably attack Clinton for past support of trade deals that he says had ”disastrous” consequences for American workers. In recent days, Clinton has laid out a plan for a ”clawback” of tax benefits for companies that ship jobs overseas, using the money to encourage investment in the United States. Sanders wrote in Sunday’s Detroit Free Press that nowhere are his differences with Clinton, a former secretary of state and senator, stronger than on trade. He also renewed his criticism of Clinton’s support for the North American Free Trade Agreement and normalized trade relations with China. ”Not only did I vote against them,” he said, ”I stood with workers on picket lines in opposition to them. Meanwhile, Secretary Clinton sided with corporate America and supported almost all of them.” With Clinton continuing to widen her considerable lead in the Democratic delegate count, Sanders sees upcoming Midwestern primaries as a crucial opportunity to slow her momentum by highlighting his trade policies. After Michigan’s vote on Tuesday, the March 15 primaries include Ohio, Illinois and Missouri. “Geographically, we’re looking good,” Sanders said Sunday on ABC’s “This Week. ” “We have a path. ” Sanders acknowledged that his campaign has yet to connect with   voters, which hurt in him badly in his South Carolina loss last month to Clinton. However, he argued that his insurgent campaign, based largely on a promise of economic equality and prosperity for the underclass, is making headway among young black voters. “I think you’re going to see those numbers change,” Sanders told ABC.   In Michigan, manufacturing jobs have rebounded from the depths of the Great Recession, but their numbers are still much lower than they were 20 years ago.

","Sen. Bernie Sanders ( ) is the winner in the New Hampshire primary, besting former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. News networks called the race for Sanders as soon as all the polls closed at 8 p. m. In his victory speech, Sanders declared his win in New Hampshire, coupled with his strong showing in Iowa, ”nothing short of the beginning of a political revolution.” ”The people of New Hampshire have sent a profound message to the political establishment,  to the economic establishment and to, by the way, the media establishment,” Sanders said. ”What the people here have said is that, given the enormous crises facing our country, it is just too late for the same old, same old establishment politics and establishment economics. The people want real change.” It’s no surprise Sanders won the state, where he had held a large lead in the polls for weeks. Sanders eclipsed Clinton in New Hampshire polls months ago. Going into election day, he was leading Clinton 55 percent to 40 percent in the TPM PollTracker Average. In recent weeks, the Clinton campaign characterized his popularity in the state as being product of his representation of a neighboring state. But his victory is nonetheless a setback for Clinton, who scored an upset over then Sen. Barack Obama in the state in 2008’s presidential race. It also comes after Clinton was barely able to eke out a win in Iowa, where she had invested a heavy ground game, perhaps to the disadvantage of her campaign operation in New Hampshire, The pressure is now on Clinton to reassert control of the race in the next Democratic 2016 states, Feb. 20th’s Nevada caucus and the Feb. 27 South Carolina primary that follows. In those places, and in the Southern states that hold their primaries in March, the Clinton campaign has argued that relatively high portions of minority voters will bulwark her against Sanders’ momentum in the mostly white Iowa and New Hampshire. ”I know there are those who want to deny the passion and the purpose you all show every day for this campaign,” Clinton said in her concession speech Tuesday. ”But you are the reason we are here and you are the reason we are going to win the nomination and then win this election together.”  The Clinton campaign circulated also a memo written by campaign manager Robby Mook almost immediately after the results were projected, stressing the importance of the March primary states, where a majority of the delegates needed to win the nomination are allotted. The memo argued Clinton, given the states’ demographics and her ground game, was   to sweep up the nomination then. Early exit polls pointed to Sanders outperforming Clinton among voters 30 and younger. His campaign has had an appeal among the youth vote throughout much of the race, but recent comments by Clinton surrogates Gloria Steinem and Madeleine Albright scolding young women for favoring Sanders further antagonized her relationship with young people. Exit polls also suggested a larger portion of “liberal voters” in this primary than in 2008, when Clinton was victorious.  In the days leading up to the primary, the Clinton campaign amped up its attacks on Sanders. Her husband, former President Bill Clinton, slammed him in recent speeches, while Clinton sharpened her criticisms of Sanders in last week’s debate. The efforts, however, were not enough to overcome Sanders’ overwhelming lead in the state. Tierney Sneed is a reporter for Talking Points Memo. She previously worked for U. S. News and World Report.

"," Fox News anchor Bret Baier apologized Friday for reporting that federal investigators had determined that Hillary Clinton’s private email server had been hacked and that an investigation would lead to an indictment of Clinton after the election. In fact, Baier said, after checking with his sources, there is no evidence at this time for either statement. Baier, the anchor of Fox’s evening newscast “Special Report,” went on the air Wednesday to report that the FBI had determined that Clinton’s private server, which she used while serving as secretary of state, had been hacked by “five foreign intelligence agencies. ” He further said on Thursday, during an interview with Fox’s Brit Hume, that a separate FBI investigation  —   of the charitable Clinton Foundation  —   was “likely” to lead to an indictment of Clinton after Tuesday’s election. Both statements, if true, would be explosive developments in the late stages of the presidential campaign between Clinton and Republican rival Donald Trump. Trump has repeatedly invoked the alleged atmosphere of corruption around the Clinton Foundation and the security risks involved in Clinton’s use of a private server while secretary of state as reasons not to vote for Clinton.     The Post’s Rosalind Helderman breaks down the latest developments of the controversies involving the FBI less than a week from Election Day. (Bastien   Washington Post)   But neither of his reports about Clinton were accurate, Baier acknowledged Friday morning in a “Fox News alert” conversation with Fox News anchor Jon Scott. Baier said he relied on a single anonymous source within the FBI for his report about an alleged hack of the server: “I was quoting from one source about his certainty that the server had been hacked by five foreign intelligence agencies. . . . As of today there still are no digital fingerprints of a breach, no matter what the working assumption is within the bureau. ” He added, “All the time, but especially in a heated election, on a topic this explosive, every word matters no matter how well sourced. ” He went on to describe his comment to Hume about an indictment  —   which he has previously called “inartful”  —   as more than that. “I explained the phrasing of one my answers to Brit Hume on Wednesday night, saying it was inartful the way I answered the last question about whether the investigations would continue after the election. And I answered that yes, our sources said it would, they would continue to, likely, an indictment. “Well, that wasn’t just inartful. It was a mistake. And for that I’m sorry. I should have said they will continue to build their case. “‘Indictment,’ obviously, is a very loaded word, Jon, especially in this atmosphere, and no one knows if there would or would not be an indictment no matter how strong investigators feel their evidence is. It’s obviously a prosecutor who has to agree to take the case and make that case to a grand jury. ” As an addendum, he added, “We stand by the sourcing on the ongoing, active Clinton Foundation investigation and are working to get sources with knowledge of the details on the record and on camera, hopefully today. ” ",0,0,0,0,0,0,7

[Woolsey began by discussing his political evolution, cheerfully taking issue with Marlow’s description of him as a   “Clintonista”: “Well, I haven’t been an ‘ ’ of anything, except over the decades, I called myself a Scoop   Lieberman Democrat,” he said, acknowledging that “there aren’t many of us left. ”  Woolsey said: I’ve served four presidents, had presidential appointments in four administrations, two Republican and two Democratic: Reagan, Bush I, Carter, and Clinton. I work in the national security area, and I think it’s important to serve the government, and have the government do the right things if you can help them in those areas. For me, politics  —   in a very   way  —   kind of stops at the water’s edge. He added, “But we’re in a very complex and difficult situation now, I think, and although I advise the Trump campaign on national security matters, obviously if I’m an adviser, I’ll get into some of these other issues a bit, too. ” He said he thought Trump did a good job on dissecting the Iran nuclear deal: He’s right, absolutely, I think on the issue. This is as bad as international agreements get. It’s not even really an agreement in which there’s   and compromises, and you get it written down, and everybody agrees you’ve got to follow it.  That’s not what the Iranians do at all. They’re into humiliation. Their purpose is to look dominant. They have no intention of following the words of the treaty, and they are not. The Obama administration has made it easy for them to profit hugely by getting the money that was sequestered as part of their other activities, supporting terrorism, and the like. So I think Trump was right on, on this one. He seemed to be   and I don’t think Hillary Clinton did a good job at answering it. Woolsey said Trump made an “excellent point” about Clinton and Obama perpetually telegraphing their   strategies to the Islamic State and other enemies: It may not have been optimally applied in this particular discussion, but he’s on to something that the Obama administration and its State Department under Hillary [have] done very badly, which is ignore the substance and be the slave of the narrative.  They fiddle around with the facts, in order to make them fit into their narrative, rather than seeing what reality is, and changing their story to comport with reality if they have to. I think that Trump raised that overall issue well, in terms of not disclosing everything that you are doing, just in order to get good PR. Within hours of bin Laden having been killed, they had people out backgrounding on how they had tricked the guards this way and how they’d done that way.  That’s just ridiculous. That’s a terrible idea. Churchill says in war, truth is always so important that it must be protected by a bodyguard of lies. They don’t protect it at all. Marlow asked if Trump did an adequate job of forcing Clinton to defend her record as secretary of state and senator. Woolsey replied that Trump “raised that spectrum of issues, but didn’t really stay with it, as long as I think it would have been a good idea. ” “It would have been better to have spent a number of minutes, and continuing to hammer on that,” he suggested, adding: When you’re hammering on something in a debate, you don’t have to growl. You can, as T. R. says, speak softly and carry a big stick. You can politely smile and raise these devastating issues about how badly she has done things, with respect to security, and her communications systems, and the works. I would have liked to have seen us stay on that one longer. Woolsey looked forward to the next debate occurring in the national security field, where he thought it was important for Trump to “get people to understand that under the Obama administration, we have let our military deteriorate badly, in terms of their readiness, in terms of the quality of their equipment, in terms of their training”: Sequestration has just done devastating things to that, so one of the things you’ve got to do is refurbish the military, and do that right. Then, also, our nuclear establishment, which has to be dealt with very carefully and very thoroughly, has been neglected. Obama hates nuclear weapons, and he doesn’t want to spend any money on trying to maintain them, so our nuclear stockpile really requires some attention. And then, finally, it’s something I think could be said and discussed to Hillary’s disadvantage, which is that you now have Russian leaders, including senior generals, talking about what they call a “no con,” the next war will be a “no contact” war. What they mean by that is that it will not be contact between shrapnel and humans. There will not be that kind of contact much. It will be a war of electronics, of hacking, of electromagnetic pulse detonations in the stratosphere, destroying people’s equipment, and so forth, and so forth. It’s a different world, and trying to deal with it the way the Obama administration has is like being in 1914 and figuring that everything from now on is just gonna be rifles. There’s never gonna be a next World War One, and then Two, and tanks, and blitzkriegs, and so forth. We’ve got a lot to make up for a neglected past. We have got a lot to do in this new world of what the Russians call   war. I don’t think this is an area Hillary is comfortable in, and I think Trump inherently understands it. He needs to confidently talk about some of these issues and give people the  —   I think accurate  —   perception that he would be a good leader in a crisis, or in a serious mess of some kind, because he’s dealt with them all his life. And Hillary would not. Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m. Eastern. LISTEN: ",0,0,0,0,0,0,9
10,10,33149,33427,52240,Why Trump should strike a deal with North Korea,CNN,,2017-03-07,2017.0,3.0,," (CNN) The United States is going through the five stages of grief over negotiations with North Korea.  First came denial: that North Korea cheats so there is no point to negotiating, which denies that past deals did stop its fissile material production and missile tests for nearly a decade and that Pyongyang was not the only one to renege. So did Washington and Seoul. Next came anger: since North Korea was violating UN resolutions by continuing to test nuclear weapons and missiles, it should be punished with sanctions and isolation. Third has come bargaining: hopes that missile defense, cyberattacks or some other technological fix could somehow shield the United States and its allies from the threat. Those hopes have so far been in vain. Fourth came depression: the problem had no solution, which was summed up by characterizing North Korea as the ”land of lousy options.” Is now the time for acceptance: that negotiating is worth another try before it is too late? Time for talks? Candidate Donald Trump seemed to reach that conclusion during his election campaign. He first broached talking to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on January 6, 2016, the very day North Korea conducted its fourth nuclear test.  ”You have this madman over there who probably would use it, and nobody talks to him other than, of course, Dennis Rodman,” he told ”Fox and Friends.” ”But nobody is talking to him whatsoever, and nobody is discussing it with China.”  Trump was more explicit on May 17. ”Who the hell cares? I’ll speak to anybody,” he said. ”There’s a 10% or 20% chance I could talk him out of having his damn nukes, because who the hell wants him to have nukes?”  In a campaign appearance on June 6, he disparaged experts’ ”qualms about bargaining with North Korea.” To a master of ”The Art of the Deal,” that posed ”no problems at all.” Trump rebuffed critics, ”They say ’we would never, ever, talk.’ How foolish they are!”  Deeds, not words, President Trump backed up his words with deeds.  After President Obama on January 19, his last full day in office, had authorized a token amount of US aid for North Korea for flood relief    the first in five years    the Trump administration made the gesture public on January 25. Trump kept creeping to the negotiating table. Despite North Korea’s   of a   missile on February 12 and the killing of Kim’s estranged   with VX nerve agent on February 13, his State Department issued visas    the first in five years    for a North Korean delegation to come to New York to meet with former officials. That outreach was abruptly reversed shortly thereafter. Will Trump try for talks again? Or will he revert to denial and try to outsource the problem to China, impose sanctions tough enough to compel the North to the negotiating table and commit to complete denuclearization upfront, wait for the regime to collapse, attempt cyberattacks, or risk a preventive war. Trump’s policy review may examine those options. All are fundamentally flawed.  China did suspend its coal imports from North Korea for a year    but only after it had already purchased its allowed quota under UN sanctions. Beijing may have anticipated that talks were in the offing and positioned itself to claim credit for coaxing Pyongyang to the negotiating table.  Pyongyang has indicated it is open to talks    but not to commit to complete denuclearization first. It may be willing to suspend its nuclear and missile programs only if Washington addresses its security concerns in return.  Will tougher sanctions compel it to the table on US terms, even force it to collapse? Proponents say they will take time to work. How long? Two years? Five years? Ten years? In the meantime, how many nuclear and missile tests will the North carry out? How much fissile material will it make? How many ICBMs will it field?  It could take three years or more for the North to develop its ICBM. Cyberwarfare could at best delay the inevitable    if that. Contemplating preventive war could rupture US alliances in Asia.  The only way out of Trump’s predicament is acceptance   resume talks with North Korea, the sooner the better, to probe whether it is willing to suspend arming.  Editor’s Note: Leon V.

11,11,48919,102378,150482,"’Death by a thousand cuts’: LGBT rights fading under Trump, advocates say",Guardian,Sabrina Siddiqui,2017-03-30,2017.0,3.0,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/mar/30/lgbt-rights-under-trump,"Gay rights advocates are sounding the alarm over what they say is a quiet campaign being waged by Donald Trump’s administration to chip away at   protections for LGBT Americans. While the White House has insisted Trump is a vocal supporter of the LGBT community, breaking from previous Republican presidents, advocacy groups were left questioning that commitment following a series of recent actions dubbed by one gay rights lawyer as “death by a thousand cuts”. The latest missive arrived on Wednesday, when the US Census Bureau said a proposal to count LGBT Americans in its 2020 report and annual survey had been a mistake. The agency said it had “inadvertently listed sexual orientation and gender identity as a proposed topic”. Last week, the Trump administration deleted questions on sexual orientation from at least two other government surveys. Chad Griffin, the president of the Human Rights Campaign (HRC) said the move was a deliberate effort by the Trump administration “to erase LGBTQ people from federal data used to inform budgets and policies across the government”. “Their intent is clear,” Griffin said in a statement. “By denying we exist, the Trump administration hopes to deny us equality. It won’t work. ”  The HRC said it had submitted a Freedom of Information Act request to the Department of Commerce in response to find out who directed the change at the Census Bureau and why. Separately, Trump signed into law on Monday a bill overturning a Barack Obama executive order that required companies seeking contracts with the federal government to show compliance with federal   laws.  Obama’s   “Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces” order sought to shield workers from violations of a range of labor and safety laws, not just those affecting LGBT individuals. But it was rolled out in tandem with another   executive action that barred discrimination against federal workers specifically on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. Sharon McGowan, the director of strategy at Lambda Legal, the country’s oldest and largest LGBT legal organization, said the Trump administration was sending a signal that   was not at the forefront of its approach. “They are going to try and chip and erode away the rights we’ve seen over the last few years, but in these   ways that may not be as obvious,” she said. “It puts us in the dark about how [workplace] violations are affecting LGBT people,” said Laura Durso, the   of the LGBT Research and Communications Project at the   Center for American Progress. Republicans who led efforts to overturn Obama’s action deemed it unnecessarily burdensome on businesses. But David Stacy, HRC’s government affairs director, said the action would render it more difficult for the Department of Labor to hold accountable federal contractors for prior violations of civil rights laws, including those against LGBT employees. “It signals that the administration could continue to repeal   policies aimed at protecting LGBTQ people,” Stacy said. On the surface, Trump has taken credit for being the first Republican presidential nominee to profess his support for LGBT Americans. The White House touted his position earlier this year, when it issued a statement confirming he would not rescind Obama’s executive order banning LGBT discrimination in the workplace. But that pledge was born from draft executive orders leaked to the media indicating the administration had, in fact, weighed not simply reversing Obama’s protections but also unraveling other LGBT rights at the federal level.  Advocates thus remain skeptical of the Trump administration’s posturing on the issue and saw some of their fears realized when the president lifted   guidance protecting the use of bathrooms by transgender students.  Since then, gay rights supporters argue, the Trump administration has taken active measures behind the scenes that undermine the LGBT community. Last week, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) eliminated questions that were designed to compile information about LGBT seniors. Roger Severino, the   chief of the HHS Office of Civil Rights, has been a forceful opponent of transgender rights in particular and other Obama efforts to protect LGBT people. Earlier this month, the Department of Housing and Urban Development declared it would withdraw two agency notices geared toward protecting LGBT people experiencing homelessness. And on 13 March, the state department included in its official US delegation to the United Nations’ 61st annual Commission on the Status of Women conference two   human rights activists. “It’s a playbook that we have seen before, which is love the sinner, hate the sin,” said Durso of the Trump administration’s public relations strategy on LGBT issues. “They get to talk out of both sides of their mouth. ” Nancy Pelosi, the House Democratic leader, joined the criticism on Wednesday in a statement decrying the Census Bureau’s decision. “Today, the Trump administration has decided that LGBT Americans shouldn’t count,” she said, while noting the trend across agencies with respect to gathering information about LGBT people.  By excluding   data collection in the 2020 Census, the Trump administration showed it did not even want to have the information needed to act in the best interest of countless American families, she said.  McGowan said the collective consequences of the Trump administration’s actions would be felt for years. The Census Bureau’s decision on Wednesday, she said, would have especially dramatic consequences for identifying communities that were at risk and in need of health funding or social services protection. “We are seeing this broader trend of erasing and eliminating any consideration of the needs of LGBT people in this administration,” she said. “We are starting to see what the death by a thousand cuts looks like. ”",0,0,0,0,0,0,11

13,13,26253,79706,120527,"A Public Option Would Cause More Problems for Obamacare’s Private Insurers, and That’s Probably the Point",National Review,James C. Capretta,2016-08-25,2016.0,8.0,"http://www.nationalreview.com/article/439328/obamacare-public-option-fix-will-further-undermine-private-insurance
","The remarkable cascade of bad news from this spring and summer about the status of the Affordable Care Act  —   a. k. a. Obamacare  —   is convincing even the law’s ardent defenders that a problem is brewing:  Aetna announced that it is pulling out of eleven of the 15 states where it currently sells products on the ACA’s exchanges because of continued large financial losses from these products. The company has lost $430 million since January 2014 on insurance plans sold through Obamacare, with more losses coming through the remainder of this year.  Blue Cross Blue Shield of Tennessee estimates that it will have lost $500 million on the state’s exchange by the end of 2016. The insurer asked and received permission from the state’s insurance regulator to hike premiums 62 percent for 2017. The other major insurers in the state  —   Cigna and Humana  —   have received permission to raise premiums by 46 and 44 percent, respectively.  Texas Blue Cross has lost $1 billion on the ACA exchange in two years, and has asked for a 60 percent premium increase for 2017.  The average premium increase nationwide for plans offered on the ACA exchanges is 24 percent for 2017. In California, where premium growth for insurance plans offered on the state’s exchange was relatively modest in 2015 and 2016, the average increase for 2017 will be 13 percent.  The consulting firm McKinsey estimates that between 12 and 17 percent of exchange customers will be picking from plans offered by only one insurer in 2017. Overall, the insurance industry is taking large losses from the plans they are offering because the risk profile of those signing up for coverage is much worse than they anticipated, or priced for. The law’s defenders argue that some insurers are doing just fine, and that is true. But, in general, the plans that are surviving more closely resemble the   plans offered to Medicaid recipients with very narrow networks of physicians participating in the plans. These are not the kind of insurance products typically offered to workers in the   setting. Moreover, as the big national insurers pull back from participating in the exchanges, their   enrollees will have to go somewhere to get coverage, and most likely that means enrolling in plans that, so far at least, haven’t yet experienced large losses. With more   enrollees shifting their way, it wouldn’t be surprising if some of the plans that turned profits in the first three years saw those profits vanish in 2017. It is not possible to operate an insurance market with an   negative margin. For a   market to survive, the insurers, on average, have to cover their costs plus a profit with their premium collections.   advocates are now offering a   plan to shore up the exchanges. First, they are calling for a concerted marketing campaign aimed at persuading the young and healthy to sign up for coverage on the exchanges. Second, they propose deducting   payments from the income calculation used to determine the subsidy amounts available to insurance enrollees. This would presumably benefit mainly younger applicants. Third, and most significantly, they want to resurrect the idea of a “public option” competing alongside the private plans. The effort to draw in more young and healthy people is unlikely to succeed. The insurance offerings on the exchanges are appealing only for people who are getting most of the premium and   requirements covered by federal subsidies. For everyone else, the plans are unattractive because the premiums are high (and rising) the deductibles are well above what most people are accustomed to, and many physicians are not participating in the plan networks. Better marketing will not change any of that. More generous subsidies for those with student loans might help at the margin, but it is unlikely to be sufficient to overcome all of the other reasons people are steering clear of the ACA products. The public option is an entirely different matter. If the problem is an unstable environment for private insurance, a public option is definitely not the solution. A public option would be a   and   insurance plan, probably modeled on the traditional Medicare program, which would be offered to customers on the exchanges as an alternative to the   plans. Unlike a   plan, there’s no particular reason why a publicly run product couldn’t experience ongoing losses, so long as the law provided for direct or indirect taxpayer subsidization. The Medicare program itself is funded heavily by taxpayer subsidies. The most consequential difference between public and private insurance is the ability to regulate prices. Private insurers must negotiate contracts with their networks of hospitals and physicians. Public insurance, like Medicare, is in the business of regulating prices, not negotiating them. Medicare, for instance, sets regulated prices for the services it covers on a      basis. Because Medicare is so important to the bottom lines of many providers, they have no choice but to take what Medicare pays, even though it is usually well below what private insurers pay for the same services. But   price controls always have a predictable result, which is reduction in those willing to supply the service at the regulated price. This is evident in the Medicaid program. Many hospital and physicians purposely steer clear of the program because of its very low reimbursement rates. As a result, Medicaid enrollees often have much more trouble accessing care than do patients with private insurance. This does not mean that a public option wouldn’t attract enrollment. It probably would because the regulated prices it would pay to providers would allow it to charge a premium below that charged by many of the private offerings. Some consumers would take that option not thinking much about what it might mean when it comes time to find a doctor to take care of them. In selling Obamacare to the electorate, President Obama argued repeatedly that the law wouldn’t lead to “ ” health care because the coverage would be delivered by private insurance, at least for those who get their insurance through the exchanges. But this was always more of a debating point rather than a statement based on conviction. The president himself has always favored public over private insurance, as do most of those who supported the legislation. The only reason a public option wasn’t included in the ACA in the first place was because a sufficient minority of Democrats in Congress feared the idea would sink the entire bill. Now that the ACA is on the books, and the   options are on shaky ground, there’s no real reason for proponents of the ACA not to fully embrace the public option. It’s what most of them wanted all along, and the turbulence among the private insurers provides the perfect excuse to pursue it. The fact that introducing a public option at this stage would only add to the instability of the private options offered on the exchanges is not a reason for the   advocates to abandon the idea because they never really wanted a functioning   marketplace anyway. The goal all along has been   health care, even if they haven’t always been willing to admit that.,",0,0,0,0,0,0,13
14,14,27614,131076,197364,The Trump-Russia allegations sound incriminating. But would any of them be illegal?,Vox,Zeeshan Aleem,2017/4/5,2017.0,4.0,http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/4/5/15168252/trump-russia-ties-illegal," The growing number of allegations about President Trump’s links to Russia sounds really incriminating. But would any of them actually be illegal?    As the FBI probes possible coordination between the Trump campaign and Moscow in the   to the 2016 election, an array of Trump associates find themselves in the crosshairs of federal and congressional investigators. There’s former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, pushed out of the White House for lying about his communications with the Russian ambassador to the US. There’s Trump adviser Roger Stone, who has admitted to exchanging messages with a hacker thought to be a front for Russian intelligence. There’s former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort, who is accused of failing to publicly disclose taking millions of dollars from a   Ukrainian political party and a Russian oligarch. There’s Carter Page, Trump’s foreign policy adviser, who advised Russia’s   gas company Gazprom and was once unsuccessfully courted by Russian spies to become one himself. And that’s not close to an exhaustive list. But there’s a difference between unseemly conduct and criminal conduct, and I spoke to legal experts to separate one from the other. What I learned is there are three main sets of laws that  —   at least given what we know now from news reports  —   could end up being the basis for criminal charges against Trump associates: violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, failing to comply with the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) and making false statements to federal investigators. All of them are felonies and carry the potential penalty of prison time.    At the moment, we don’t know exactly what information the FBI has or if anything especially damning will come to light, and there’s no indication that Trump himself would be implicated in any charges related to cooperating with Russia during or immediately after the election. But if his closest aides end up being indicted for effectively working with a foreign power that the US doesn’t have friendly relations with in order to undermine the US electoral process, that would likely create a political crisis of Watergate proportions.     Why treason isn’t on the table but other crimes are The legal experts I spoke to almost all said, without prompting, that the issues at play here didn’t come anywhere close to treason, a word tossed around by some advocates on the American left. That’s because being guilty of treason would mean that someone from Trump’s team would have to have been aiding a country or group that was legally at war with the US. Russia isn’t.    “Formally, we’re at peace with Russia, so even the most outrageous assistance to Russia or benefit to Russia wouldn’t count as treason,” Carlton Larson, a law professor at the University of California Davis, told me.  When Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were prosecuted in the 1950s for sharing atomic secrets with the Soviet Union, they were tried for espionage, not treason, for this exact reason. The Cold War was already underway, but the US and Russia were technically at peace. If the Rosenbergs weren’t guilty of treason back then, it’s almost impossible to conceive of how Trump affiliates could be guilty of it today. But those experts say there are many other acts the FBI is likely looking into that could potentially amount to criminal activity. A substantial caveat: We don’t know what kind of information and evidence the FBI has, so right now we’re operating in the realm of educated conjecture based largely on news reports. That said, there are three big sets of possible violations that are most likely being investigated:      Whether any Trump campaign members encouraged or aided the hackers who broke into the email servers of the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton chair John Podesta, in violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.  Whether any Trump campaign or administration officials intentionally avoided registering with the Department of Justice that they were working for a foreign government or other foreign entity under FARA. So far, we know Flynn didn’t register for his paid activities on behalf of the Turkish government on the campaign trail until March. We also recently learned that in past years Manafort did not disclose his work on behalf of a Russian oligarch with the intention of advancing Putin’s agenda, and failed to do so with activities for a   Ukrainian political party. Whether Trump associates have made false statements to federal investigators. This could be particularly dangerous for Flynn, who reportedly misled the FBI about his phone calls with the Russian ambassador to the US in December.   They’re all felonies, although some are enforced more rigorously than others.  What laws the Trump team really needs to worry about Based on what we know, the FBI’s top priority is to determine if any of Trump’s associates cooperated with the hackers who broke into the email servers of the DNC and Podesta.   Whoever hacked the servers almost certainly violated the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, which bars unauthorized intrusion into a computer or computer network and makes it a federal crime. The intelligence community believes those cyberattacks were carried out by Russian hackers taking orders from Russian President Vladimir Putin.  The question is whether anyone from the Trump campaign knew what Russia was doing and encouraged it or helped Moscow choose specific targets. Someone on the campaign could also be charged for promising some kind of quid pro quo in exchange for the hack. That could be punishable with up to 10 years in prison. Another likely major focal point for the FBI probe is the Trump team’s compliance with FARA, a statute that dates back to the World War II era. In the US, private citizens have freedom to work on behalf of foreign governments or foreign entities affiliated with the government  —   but they have to register with the US to disclose that they’re doing so. A failure to register is a felony offense. There’s also a separate statute that holds that public officials in the US cannot act as foreign agents at all.    So far, there have been a few major revelations that suggest Trump associates may have violated FARA laws. In March, we learned that Flynn failed to disclose the fact that he was being paid to lobby on behalf of the Turkish government while serving as an adviser to Trump on the campaign trail, and only registered retroactively in March.     We also know that Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort had failed to disclose lobbying on behalf of   Ukrainian political leaders in previous years, as well as a Russian oligarch in Putin’s inner circle. Federal investigators are almost certainly looking into whether Flynn, Manafort, and other Trump advisers deliberately defied the mandate of FARA while working for those and other foreign entities. FARA is typically lightly enforced  —   the Justice Department tends to bug violators to comply with it rather than taking them to court. But it is a felony if registration is violated intentionally, and it can be punished with prison time. “It’s not something that the government generally tries to criminally enforce, but they could,” Ryan Goodman, an NYU law professor and former senior Pentagon lawyer, told me. The biggest potential danger facing the Trump team has to do with whether they’ve told the truth in their interviews with federal investigators. It’s not illegal to lie to the press, but it is illegal to lie to the FBI, and federal prosecutors routinely bring charges in such cases. Flynn may have the most to lose since news reports suggest he misled FBI agents about whether he discussed sanctions with the Russian ambassador to the US in December. What he discussed with the ambassador appears to contradict what he told the FBI, but he also followed his denial to the FBI by saying he didn’t recall all of his conversation, and he disputes whether the exact terms he discussed really counted as part of Obama’s sanctions package. In other words, the case might not be that simple. But that could be a factor in why Flynn offered to testify before Congress in exchange for immunity from prosecution. As Goodman notes, false statements are not that hard to pin down and are often used to convict   people when prosecutors can’t necessarily prove the underlying crime, like with Lewis “Scooter” Libby, Dick Cheney’s chief of staff, who was convicted for lying about his role in the leak of an undercover CIA officer’s identity. The biggest issue is the political fallout It’s too soon to know what charges, if any, federal prosecutors might bring against Trump associates, let alone whether any would be convicted.     In the short term, the more immediately consequential issue is the possibility that some of Trump’s associates might flip on their bosses and reveal misdeeds by senior members of the Trump campaign or transition team. Having   Trump associates convicted of criminal acts tied to the election would be politically toxic for Trump  —   and would also put him in a tough position. “If we enter a phase in which the national conversation turns to whether the president will exercise his pardon power for some of the Americans currently under FBI investigation, we will have likely crossed over into a crisis of immense Watergate proportions,” Goodman says.  Stephen Vladeck, a national security law expert at the University of Texas, agrees  —   and says that whether Trump’s associates broke the law is likely to be just the opening act of this story. “I’m not holding my breath about any of these cases going to trial,” Vladeck told me. “To me, the real story is whether indictments of any current or former senior Trump staffers might open the door to discovery of additional inappropriate   unlawful conduct by other senior Trump officials  —   perhaps including the president himself. ” That’s possible, of course. It’s also entirely possible that neither Trump nor anybody in his White House will end up facing any charges at all. The only thing we know now is that less than three months into the Trump era, this investigation is taking the US into entirely uncharted waters.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,14

Trump Russia story is a hoax. #MAGA!  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 28, 2017,  Trump’s assertion that   of State Clinton “allowed big Uranium to go to Russia” and Bill Clinton’s   “Russian speech” were allegations first reported by The New York Times (NYT) and based on research from the NYT bestseller Clinton Cash, authored by Breitbart News    Peter Schweizer. The facts found in Clinton Cash, reported by the NYT, and deemed accurate by establishment media reveal how Clinton’s tenure as Secretary of State coincided with the influx of tens of millions of dollars from foreign sources into the Clinton Foundation which resulted in favorable actions for Russia’s government. Indeed the Clinton Foundation had received millions in donations from several investors in Uranium One, a   company in which a majority stake was sold to Russia’s nuclear energy agency, Rosatom, in a lucrative deal needing approval from Clinton’s State Department and eight other federal agencies. “The sale gave the Russians control of   of all uranium production capacity in the United States,” The New York Times confirmed.  The “deal,” as Trump points out, refers to how donations to the Clinton Foundation from executives of   Uranium One had exceeded $145 million, according to the New York Times. In fact, those Clinton Foundation donations from uranium investors spiked just as the deal for Russia’s Rosatom to secure Uranium One was being finalized. A troublesome series of undisclosed donations came from former Uranium One chairman Ian Telfer. Telfer made four foreign donations totaling $2. 35 million to the Clinton Foundation while the uranium deal was being negotiated. However, the Times noted, “those contributions were not publicly disclosed by the Clintons, despite an agreement Mrs. Clinton had struck with the Obama White House to publicly identify all donors. Other people with ties to the company made donations as well. ” “We made mistakes, as many organizations of our size do, but we are acting quickly to remedy them,” The Clinton Foundation admitted at the time. But Hillary Clinton’s failure to disclose the millions in donations her family foundation received from Teller was a direct violation of the Memorandum of Understanding she signed with the Obama administration promising to disclose all foreign donations during her tenure as Secretary of State. More troubling still, was the $500, 000 speech Bill Clinton delivered in Moscow that was paid for by “a Russian investment bank that had ties to the Kremlin” at the time of the Uranium One deal, the New Yorker confirmed. “Why was Bill Clinton taking any money from a bank linked to the Kremlin while his wife was Secretary of State?” asks the liberal publication. Trump’s calls for a federal investigation into the Clintons’ Russia ties come amid a partisan push to link the President and his aides to Russian   and collusion during the presidential campaign.

","New York  —   Donald Trump began his summit with social conservatives here Tuesday by promising to stay for as long as it would take to answer their questions and address their concerns. But after an uneventful 75 minutes during which he fielded only five or six inquiries from the audience  —   and offered little in the way of new or revelatory answers  —   the presumptive nominee departed from the sixth floor of the Marriott Marquis in Times Square. He left behind an Evangelical movement united by visceral opposition to Hillary Clinton yet still divided by his own candidacy. Such was the reality of Tuesday’s   meeting: After all the hype, nothing was said or done to fundamentally alter the uneasy relationship between Trump and the Christian Right. In interviews with a dozen attendees, the most common assessment of Trump’s performance was a shrug. He checked boxes on policy issues, they said, and played to the crowd’s greatest insecurity by repeatedly referencing the Supreme Court as a reminder of what’s at stake in November. Some activists reluctantly acknowledged afterward that they personally plan to vote for him. But many of these individuals were present Tuesday due to their leadership roles in large,   organizations strikingly, none of them are yet willing to extend Trump an endorsement that could mobilize their constituents on his behalf. RELATED: Don’t Bend Your Knee to Trump, Evangelicals, “Overall it was positive, just because he was here. And personally, he has my vote,” says Penny Nance, president of Concerned Women for America. “But the question still is whether I can feel confident in asking people to join me. ” Nance was one of roughly 50 VIPs that met with Trump privately before the bigger gathering. He took no questions in that meeting, and “even there, everything was completely boilerplate,” she says. RELATED: Trump Is Holding the GOP Hostage, For the larger session, some 50, 000 questions had been submitted from Christian activists around the country, with organizers narrowing the submissions to a list of 20  —   and even then, Trump tackled only a fraction of that list. People in the room say he offered acceptable, if uninventive, commentary on issues such as religious liberty, immigration, social justice, the Supreme Court, and Israel. Share article on FacebookshareTweet Trump, attendees say, played it safe and catered to his audience with carefully prepared phrases such as “  judges” and “right to religious freedom. ” He also raised, unsolicited, his concerns about a    law that could threaten the   status of churches that speak out on social issues. It may not have been a tour de force, but Trump’s supporters in the room believe he hit the right notes to soothe the anxieties of    conservatives in attendance. “It was music to their ears,” says Ralph Reed, president of the Faith and Freedom Coalition and a member of Trump’s newly announced Evangelical Executive Advisory Board. Reed acknowledges that Trump didn’t break new ground with any promises or policy proposals. But just by attending Tuesday’s event, he argues, Trump made inroads with a constituency that has viewed him with suspicion and even hostility. “Woody Allen famously said half of life is showing up,” Reed says. “He showed up today. ” (Allen actually said it was 80 percent of life.) Trump was given a warm welcome thanks to glowing introductions from Jerry Falwell Jr. and Franklin Graham, both heirs to a religious Right whose influence has waned in recent years. Their family names still carry enormous currency in evangelical circles, however, and they made the case that while Trump doesn’t share their traditional faith background, Christians should nonetheless accept him as one of their own. “They vouched for him. And that’s meaningful to me,” says E. W. Jackson, a minister and conservative activist who was the nominee for lieutenant governor of Virginia in 2013. “I think there a lot of Christians that question [Trump’s faith] so hearing that from evangelicals of their stature was very encouraging to me. ” Trump’s outreach was also aided by Ben Carson and Mike Huckabee, two former rivals for the Republican presidential nomination who remain popular with the   base. Carson lent his name to help organize the event and was in attendance Tuesday Huckabee served as the moderator of Trump’s Q  A session. He broke the ice by joking that everyone in the room was happy to see Trump on stage  —   except he and Carson. Huckabee, who hosted a Fox News show for many years, fit the profile of a friendly emcee. But multiple attendees took issue with his role in the proceedings. “I don’t understand why Huckabee was the moderator,” says Tom DeLay, the former House majority leader. “Huckabee sold out for Trump. This was supposed to be a meeting of people who had real concerns. I love Mike Huckabee, but I don’t think it was appropriate to have him as the moderator in this particular setting. He spent half the time  —   half of our time  —   cheerleading for Trump. ” RELATED: There Is No Other, More ‘Presidential’ Donald Trump, The organizers made clear that nobody was planning an inquisition. But between Huckabee’s commentary,    from attendees, and Trump’s own rambling answers, participants voiced frustration that there was only time for a handful of questions  —   none of which probed Trump on his own faith or sought explanation for his multiple shifts on abortion, which were priorities for some attendees coming in. Trump teased the VIP group by telling them of Christianity, “I owe so much to it in so many ways. ” In a video posted to Twitter by Jackson, he proceeded to say that he wouldn’t be standing before them without it  —   not because of how it shaped his life or informed his worldview, but “because the Evangelical vote was mostly gotten by me. ” Increasingly, however, top social conservatives are accepting the reality that Trump will never think or talk like they do. The arguments made by Falwell and Graham on Tuesday  —   that it’s unfair to compare Trump with idealized Christian leaders  —   are echoed by other attendees, many of whom are still struggling to reconcile Trump’s many manifest shortcomings with the fact that he alone stands between Clinton and the White House. “Who he is in his faith journey, it doesn’t reflect the room. There’s no question about it,” says Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the Susan B. Anthony List, an   group. “All along the way, he was our last choice. But when you get to the end, to the point of having a binary choice, you must choose. It’s what our system has given us. ” Still, Dannenfelser  —   like Perkins, Nance, and many other attendees  —   declined to endorse Trump on Tuesday.

Many of the prominent activists who came to New York, Perkins included, were vocal supporters of Ted Cruz in the GOP primaries. Some, such as Iowa Evangelical leader Bob Vander Plaats, regularly mocked Trump’s botched citation of “Two Corinthians” and his admission that he’d never asked God for forgiveness. Six months later, they are doing their best to downplay these “differences” while defending Trump from other conservatives who haven’t come around. “The Bible is full of men and women that repeatedly made grave errors,” says Gary Bauer, the longtime activist leader and 2000 presidential candidate who also backed Cruz in 2016. “Who is it that they’re holding up as this paragon, a man or woman without sin that they could have nominated for president?” Bauer adds: “There’s only one person who fits that description, and when he returns the election will be canceled. ”,",0,0,0,0,0,0,16

","     “Sean, we’ve got to get to the bottom of it. We’ve got to find out whether Mr. Amiri, who was executed this last weekend, was essentially, he became public because of the revelations in Hillary Clinton’s email.   …     It is heartbreaking to think that someone who would have cooperated, as reports indicated, with the United States and with our interests, to the security of our nation, would have lost their life because of the recklessness and carelessness of Hillary Clinton using a private server. We don’t know that that’s the case, it’s being reported, but we absolutely have to get to the bottom of it. The American people have a right to know. ”  —   GOP vice presidential nominee Mike Pence, on the Sean Hannity radio show, Aug. 8, 2016 The Trump campaign has been asking questions about whether the execution in Iran of a former defector to the United States was related to Hillary Clinton’s private email server. The insinuation is that somehow her emails led to the Iranian scientist’s death. As Pence put it, he could have lost his life “because of the recklessness and carelessness of Hillary Clinton using a private server. ” Here’s a tweet from Trump, using his favorite locution (“many people are saying”) for making a claim without actually saying it himself:   Many people are saying that the Iranians killed the scientist who helped the U. S. because of Hillary Clinton’s hacked emails.  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 8, 2016   Truly, this is among the stupidest claims made so far in this campaign. There’s an easy way to figure this out before you make a fool of yourself on the radio or on Twitter: Simply check the newspaper clips. We have assembled below the mentions of Shahram Amiri, the executed scientist, in The Washington Post in 2009 and 2010, and then placed the emails to Clinton in the timeline. You will note that the emails in question do not even mention his name  —   which appeared frequently on the front page of The Post and other newspapers at the time. The Facts Oct. 8, 2009: Iran Blames U. S. in Disappearance of Scientist Iran’s foreign minister on Wednesday accused the United States of being involved in the disappearance of an Iranian scientist with alleged links to Iran’s nuclear program. The charge comes less than a week after Iran reached tentative accords with the United States and other major powers on addressing questions about its nuclear ambitions, including letting international inspectors visit its newly disclosed   site near Qom. The charge also comes as the United States has raised questions about Americans being held in Iran. The scientist, Shahram Amiri, vanished during a pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia four months ago; Iran previously called on Saudi Arabia to help locate him. He is a researcher at Malek Ashtar University, which is connected to Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps and was listed by the European Union last year as an entity linked to Iran’s nuclear activities or weapon delivery systems. Dec. 15, 2009: Iran intends to go forward with espionage trial of 3 Americans Iran also is concerned about Shahram Amiri, a nuclear physicist who disappeared in June during a pilgrimage to Mecca, Saudi Arabia. Some media reports have said Amiri was seeking asylum abroad, but the Iranian Foreign Ministry charged that Saudi authorities handed him over to the United States and that now “he is among 11 jailed Iranians in America. ” March 31, 2010: U. S. world leaders press Iran on its nuclear program On Tuesday, ABC News reported that U. S. officials had confirmed the defection of Iranian scientist Shahram Amiri, who vanished last summer during a pilgrimage to Mecca in Saudi Arabia. The report said Amiri had defected to the CIA in an “intelligence coup” and had been resettled in the United States. April 25, 2010: Discontented Iranian officials provide wealth of intelligence In recent weeks, U. S. officials have acknowledged that an Iranian nuclear scientist defected to the West in June. Shahram Amiri, 32, vanished while on a religious pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia and has provided spy agencies with details about sensitive programs, including a     plant near the city of Qom, intelligence officials and   diplomats said. Amiri is described by some as the most significant Iranian defector since Brig. Gen. Ali Reza Asgari, a former deputy defense minister and Revolutionary Guard Corps commander who switched sides during a 2007 trip to Turkey. June 9, 2010: Mystery deepens over vanished Iranian scientist The apparent defection last year of an Iranian nuclear scientist with a presumed trove of secrets was hailed by U. S. officials as an “intelligence coup. ” Yet here was the same scientist appearing in a crude video this week saying he had been abducted and tortured. And then popping up in a second video, retracting the story. July 5, 2010: email sent by Richard Morningstar, State Department special envoy for Eurasian energy, forwarded to Clinton “Per the subject we discussed, we have a diplomatic, ‘psychological’ issue, not a legal issue. Our friend has to be given a way out. We should recognize his concerns and frame it in terms of a misunderstanding with no malevolent intent and that we will make sure there is no recurrence. Our person won’t be able to do anything anyway. If he has to leave so be it. ”  July 5, 2010 Email by GlennKesslerWP on Scribd July 12, 2010: email sent to Clinton by deputy chief of staff Jake Sullivan “The gentleman   …     has apparently gone to his country’s interests section because he is unhappy with how much time it has taken to facilitate his departure. This could lead to problematic news stories in the next 24 hours. ”  July 12, 2010 Email by GlennKesslerWP on Scribd July 13, 2010: Clinton answers a question from a reporter about Amiri “Mr. Amiri has been in the United States of his own free will and he is free to go. In fact, he was scheduled to travel to Iran yesterday but was unable to make all of the necessary arrangements to reach Iran through transit countries.   …     He’s free to go. He was free to come. These decisions are his alone to make. ” July 14, 2010: Iranian scientist heads homeward in anger An Iranian nuclear scientist who had disappeared in Saudi Arabia last summer stepped out of a cab in front of Iran’s diplomatic mission in Washington on Monday, asking for a ticket back to his homeland. Shahram Amiri told officials that he had been abducted by U. S. intelligence operatives and had spent much of the past year in Tucson being questioned about Iran’s nuclear ambitions. July 15, 2010: U. S. paid $5 million to Iranian scientist The Iranian nuclear scientist who claimed to have been abducted by the CIA before departing for his homeland Wednesday was paid more than $5 million by the agency to provide intelligence on Iran’s nuclear program, U. S. officials said. Shahram Amiri is not obligated to return the money but might be unable to access it after breaking off what U. S. officials described as significant cooperation with the CIA and abruptly returning to Iran. Officials said he might have left out of concern that the Tehran government would harm his family. The Pinocchio Test As can be seen with this timeline of newspaper articles, the defection and then return of Amiri was widely covered in the news media in 2009 and 2010. Iranian officials could have learned everything they needed to know about Amiri’s defection from reading The Post. Moreover, Iran first publicly raised questions about his disappearance. There was little to be learned from the cryptic messages in Clinton’s emails, even if Iran had somehow gained access to Clinton’s server. Mystery solved! And four more Pinocchios for Donald Trump.

18,18,8547,8547,27283,Physicians on Ryan’s Obamacare 2.0: ‘Doomed for Failure’ - Breitbart,Breitbart,Dr. Susan Berry,2017-03-07,2017.0,3.0,,"Physicians urging     health care say House Speaker Paul Ryan’s newly released proposal to repeal Obamacare does not actually repeal the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and, therefore, is “doomed for failure. ”[“Since this does not completely repeal the ACA, we are still left with thousands of pages of regulations that will have unknown consequences in the future,” Dr. Gerard Gianoli, of the   Ear and Balance Institute, tells Breitbart News. “The GOP plan is worse than a repeal with no replacement plan at all. ”  Gianoli explains: It will not prevent the death spiral of the insurance industry, which will be now blamed on Republicans, and the march toward a     system will continue. The GOP plan is doomed for failure. Instead of returning the insurance market to the vigor of a free market, the government will be supporting it with tax credits  —   the flip side of the ACA insurance penalty. Gianoli says the difference between Obama’s health insurance plan and Ryan’s proposal amounts to semantics: The difference is considering whether the bottle is half full or half empty. In other words, there really isn’t any difference. Further, the stipulation of preventing the insurance industry from   premiums from initial policy inception will lead to continued gaming of the system that will not be adequately adjusted by the “30% penalty” for interrupted coverage. Hopefully, this plan will not be passed. Dr. Jane Orient, executive director of the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, also observes to Breitbart News that the new proposal  —   kept secret by Ryan until its release  —   “is 57 pages with a number of ‘repeal this’ and ‘repeal that’ clauses, but no ‘repeal ACA. ’” “So to paraphrase Nancy Pelosi, what is still in it?” Orient asks. “Was that the subject of secret meetings with special interests?” Orient continues: “Refundable” tax credits  —   for those who don’t owe taxes  —   are still a subsidy. It is still redistribution of wealth, with winners (those who get the subsidy) and losers (those who pay for it). And the chief winner is the “health plan. ” It gets money the supposed beneficiary may get nothing, or only rationed care from a narrow network. “The problem is comprehensive   payment,” Orient adds. “The bill perpetuates this disastrous concept. A true   bill  —   “there shall be a free market in health insurance”  —   would remove all federal mandates, subsidies, barriers to competition, or protections or advantages for cartels. ” Conservatives such as former House Freedom Caucus chairman Jim Jordan and Virginia Rep. Dave Brat also object to Ryan’s proposed Obamacare repeal plan, asserting it is still Obamacare in a different form. “The bill maintains many of the federal features including a new entitlement program as well as most of the insurance regulations,” Brat said. “Now [they] are saying we’re going to do repeal and replace but the bill does nothing of the sort. [Speaker] Paul Ryan has always said the entire rationale for this bill is to bend the cost curve down, and so far I have seen no evidence that this bill will bring the cost curve down. ”",0,0,0,0,0,0,18
19,19,27888,27894,46654,Clinton Strategist: We’ll Only Talk About More Debates If Sanders’ Campaign Has Right ’Tone’ - Breitbart,Breitbart,Ian Hanchett,2016-03-28,2016.0,3.0,,"Hillary for America Chief Strategist Joel Benenson said that the Clinton camp wouldn’t discuss debating fellow Democratic candidate Senator Bernie Sanders ( ) in Brooklyn before New York’s April 19th primary until they saw “what kind of tone he sets” and “Let’s see the tone of the campaign he wants to run before we get to any other questions”  on Monday’s broadcast of CNN’s “At This Hour. ”  Benenson was asked by anchor Kate Bolduan if the Clinton campaign would agree to debate in Brooklyn before New York’s primary. He responded, “I think what was notable this weekend, wasn’t so much that, but in my mind was the Washington Post story with his own campaign talking about how they’re poll testing more negative attacks on Hillary Clinton. They’re talking about running harsher negatives now. We saw them run negative ads. ” Bolduan responded, “Don’t distract here Joel. Are you going to  —   why wouldn’t you debate?” Benenson then said, “Because I think the real question is what kind of campaign is Senator Sanders going to run going forward. He pumped $4 million in, the weekend before March 15th, and he lost all five states on March 15th. They spent about $4 million running negative ads. ” Bolduan protested that this was irrelevant to the discussion of the debate. Benenson replied, “This is a man who said he’d never run a negative ad, ever. He’s now running them. They’re now planning to run more. Let’s see the tone of the campaign he wants to run before we get to any other questions. ” Bolduan pointed to previous statements from the Clinton campaign that they were open to more debates, and asked why they wouldn’t agree to one in New York. Benenson stated that the campaign agreed to debates “up to a certain point. ” And was now out campaigning. When asked what the risk of holding another debate was, Benenson answered, “There’s no risk. She’s done very well in the debates. The debates have been very good But Senator Sanders doesn’t get to decide when we debate, particularly when he’s running a very negative campaign against. Let’s see if he goes back to the kind of tone he said he was going to set early on. If he does that, then we’ll talk about debates. But we’re not going to talk about it  —  . ” Bolduan then cut in to ask, “So no chance of a New York debate?” Benenson responded, “I didn’t say that. I said we’re not going to talk about it. We’re going to see what kind of tone he sets. If his campaign wants to run the kind of negative campaign, and run negative adslike they did, in North Carolina, in Illinois, all over the country on March 15th, that’s going to be disappointing to a lot of Democrats, who feel we have to start focusing on Republicans, whether it’s Donald Trump, or Ted Cruz, and about our differences, so we win in November. That’s what Democrats ought to be doing. That’s what she’s doing. ” (  America Rising) Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett",0,0,0,0,0,0,19
20,20,4769,4769,22578,"Trump, a Free-Form Leader, Experiments and Invites Drama - The New York Times",New York Times,Alexander Burns,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,,"It began at dawn, with a Twitter post about  . In a period of just over 24 hours, stretching from the early hours of Tuesday into Wednesday morning,   Donald J. Trump raced through perhaps the most frenetic day of activity since the election. With a series of surprise announcements and impulsive public gestures, he brought into sharp focus the freewheeling and compulsively theatrical style he will bring to the Oval Office. There was the incendiary pronouncement about the flag: After Fox News aired a segment about protests that included   Mr. Trump suggested stripping people who burned the flag of their citizenship, even though the act is constitutionally protected free speech. There were hazy but   statements of policy: Mr. Trump announced a tentative pact with the   company Carrier to protect some jobs at an Indiana factory, and pledged again to sever ties with his real estate empire, without offering specifics. There was a new and indiscreet round of tryouts for secretary of state, featuring reviews from the   in something like real time. Having paraded David H. Petraeus, the former military commander and C. I. A. director, past a throng of reporters for a meeting on Monday, Mr. Trump dined on Tuesday with Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential nominee in 2012 and another candidate for the job. They huddled at a French restaurant on Central Park West in Manhattan, briefly admitting the news media to take photographs of the smiling pair over scallops. On display, if not on the menu, was government à la Trump. While Mr. Trump’s focus appeared to careen unpredictably from hour to hour, the larger pattern he followed was a familiar one. As a candidate, Mr. Trump operated largely on gut instinct, with   provocation as his chief tactic. Trusting few people outside a circle of intimates, Mr. Trump thrived in a daily cycle of controversy and cultivated an atmosphere of   drama and division within his campaign. Much as he did during the campaign, Mr. Trump has kept the political world hanging on his every move, no matter how impetuous or trivial. He has aired his partial or fleeting thoughts, toying with the idea of making Rudolph W. Giuliani his secretary of state before appearing to lose interest. He has tolerated and even welcomed unsubtle combat over his selections, allowing a senior adviser, Kellyanne Conway, to roundly attack Mr. Romney on television while he remains a top contender for the cabinet. When Mr. Trump has incited controversy  —   with his   Twitter post, or an earlier allegation of mass voter fraud  —   he has declined to elaborate or justify his claims, and has left aides struggling to defend them, when they have tried at all. Mr. Trump’s method, friends and allies say, matches the reputation he built first in New York and then on reality television  —   less as a traditional corporate executive, like Mr. Romney, than as an eager impresario who experimented freely, welcomed conflict and flopped repeatedly. Newt Gingrich, a former speaker of the House who has advised Mr. Trump, said Mr. Trump’s transition process “very much resembles the way he operated in ‘The Apprentice,’” the NBC show in which Mr. Trump functioned as an imposing protagonist subjecting aspiring entrepreneurs to contests of business acumen. Mr. Gingrich said Mr. Trump plainly relished personal contact with possible appointees and favored a   leadership style. Mr. Trump did not emerge, Mr. Gingrich said, from a “corporate, staffed background,” but from a more   improvisational environment. “In a lot of ways, what you’re seeing is the continuation of techniques and lessons he learned from doing what was, at one time, the No. 1 TV show,” Mr. Gingrich said. For longtime critics of Mr. Trump, the spectacle of his transition has come as a kind of nightmarish vindication, seeming to confirm their warnings about what it would mean to have a reality television star in the nation’s most powerful office. Mr. Trump’s rivals in the Republican primary campaign often criticized him as a showman and not a real executive. At a Washington dinner in 2011, President Obama ridiculed the notion that Mr. Trump could run for president, recounting an episode of “The Celebrity Apprentice” in which Mr. Trump fired the actor Gary Busey and joking, “These are the kind of decisions that would keep me up at night. ” Jon Lovett, a former speechwriter for Mr. Obama who was an author of his speech belittling Mr. Trump, described a sense of horror at seeing the joke turn into reality. “It is extremely chilling that Donald Trump views the spectacle of choosing cabinet appointments in a way that is similar to deciding whether or not to fire Lil Jon or Joan Rivers,” Mr. Lovett said, referring to contestants on the show. It would be difficult to overstate the extremity of Mr. Trump’s departure from recent presidential practice. His immediate predecessors prided themselves on orderly, fastidious deliberations: George W. Bush as the first president with a business degree, Mr. Obama as a candidate branded by aides as “no drama Obama. ” Even Republicans concede that it is not clear how Mr. Trump’s   approach to the transition will carry over to governing. Mr. Gingrich predicted during the Republican primary contests that a Trump administration would function as a kind of daily adventure. “If Trump does end up winning, you will have no idea each morning what’s going to happen,” he said in a January interview, “because he will have no idea. ” But enacting sweeping changes or passing even modest legislation requires intensive, sustained attention from presidents and their teams, of a kind Mr. Trump has never dedicated to matters of policy. Since the election, Mr. Trump has made only a few   announcements aimed at soothing controversy or bolstering his popularity, like the Carrier deal or his pledge to preserve elements of the Affordable Care Act. But he has not situated any of his pronouncements within a larger, cohesive agenda, or answered even basic questions about them, like whether the terms extended to Carrier should be made available to other companies. Mr. Trump has appeared comparatively uninterested in a set of   appointments in which his close advisers, like Mike Pence, the vice   and Reince Priebus, the incoming White House chief of staff, have quietly installed Republican stalwarts. On Tuesday, after Mr. Trump raged on Twitter about   his transition team announced the selection of Elaine L. Chao, a former labor secretary, to lead the Department of Transportation, and Representative Tom Price of Georgia, a conservative   as Mr. Trump’s choice for health secretary. On Twitter, Mr. Trump made only one perfunctory mention each of Ms. Chao and Mr. Price, the man who would most likely be tasked with carrying out some of the  ’s most important campaign promises. By comparison, on Monday and Tuesday, Mr. Trump posted on Twitter twice about the Carrier deal and five times to criticize CNN for its coverage of him. Michael O. Leavitt, a former governor of Utah who prepared Mr. Romney’s transition team before the 2012 election, said a presidential transition usually “takes on the personality of the principal. ” Mr. Trump, he said, was taking an exceptionally public approach and showing far less regard than usual for the privacy of job candidates. “This is Donald Trump doing it his way, and no one should expect any different,” Mr. Leavitt said. “That doesn’t mean it’s right or wrong  —   it’s just Trump. ”",0,0,0,0,0,0,20

Trump becomes president, soldiers have a duty to question his authority and criticize him. Obama also said the Second Amendment and global warming can be blamed for terrorism. [Obama stood before soldiers at MacDill Air Force Base, in Tampa, Florida on Tuesday, December 6, to talk about “the foundation that we will leave for the next administration,” CNSNews. com reported.  Characterizing the military’s mission as a fight against “violent extremism,” Obama insisted that soldiers need to rise up against Trump if they feel he is pushing policies that are ill considered. Obama told the troops, “each of us has  …    the universal right to speak your minds and to protest against authority to live in a society that’s open and free that can criticize our president without retribution. ” Obama went on to insist that a proper U. S. policy against “violent extremism” is a “long term” policy. “So rather than offer false promises that we can eliminate terrorism by dropping more bombs or deploying more and more troops or fencing ourselves off from the rest of the world,” Obama said, “we have to take a long view of the terrorist threat. And we have to pursue a smart strategy that can be sustained. In the time remaining, let me just suggest what I think should guide this approach. ” The lame duck president also went on to blame terrorism on the Second Amendment and global warming. In addressing the   Middle East, Obama insisted that global warming forms a large part of that conflict. “A changing climate is increasing competition for food and water,” which, he claimed, drives the conflict in Syria and other nearby nations. Obama also blamed the Second Amendment to the U. S. Constitution for “violent extremism” in the United States. “Somebody who is trying to kill and willing to be killed is dangerous, particularly when we live in a country where it’s very easy for that person to buy a very powerful weapon,” Obama insisted. The presidential   also placed blame on the Constitution’s First Amendment, hinting that he thinks free speech is too freely indulged to prevent “impressionable minds” from being warped by “extremism” on the Internet. Obama touted his efforts to limit the reach of terror recruiters online saying, “We’ve worked with our tech sector to support efforts to push back on terrorist messages on social media that motivate people to kill. ” The president also defended Islam against the charge of extremism: We are fighting terrorists who claim to fight on behalf of Islam. But they do not speak for over a billion Muslims around the world, and they do not speak for American Muslims including many who wear the uniform of the United States of America’s military. If we stigmatize good patriotic Muslims, that just feeds the terrorists’ narrative. It fuels the same false grievances they they use to motivate people to kill. If we act like this is a war between the United States and Islam, we’re not gonna lose more Americans to terrorist attacks, but we’ll also lose the sight of the very principles we claim to defend, As to the rise of ISIS, Obama insisted it was not given aide by his actions of pulling out of Iraq in 2011 but was instead given succor by the policies of George W. Bush. “By 2011, Iraqis wanted our military presence to end, and they were unwilling to sign a new status of forces agreement to protect our troops from prosecution if they were trying to defend themselves in Iraq,” Obama proclaimed. “In addition, maintaining American troops in Iraq at the time could not have reversed the forces that contributed to ISIL’s rise. ” Obama added, “Some of the mistakes of the 2003 invasion have helped to give rise to the organization that became ISIL in the first place. ” Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail. com.",0,0,0,0,0,0,21

Trump may rail against Wall Street and business elites at his campaign rallies, but that has not stopped him from turning to many of them for economic advice. On Friday, Mr. Trump announced his economic team, just days before he is expected to give a speech in Detroit on Monday about what he would do to improve American growth. The   team  —   all men  —   includes several billionaire bankers and investment managers, and even a   professional poker player. Many have been in business with Mr. Trump before. Having such moguls on the team not only expands Mr. Trump’s network of Wall Street donors and contacts, but may also reassure the financial community that it need not be too alarmed by some of the candidate’s populist oratory. Even so, several of those named often have expressed views against the economic mainstream, voicing suspicions about the Federal Reserve and global trade deals. “They certainly can provide many useful insights, assuming Trump is willing to listen to them  —   it’s just I would like to see more diversity in terms of expertise and background,” said James Pethokoukis, a commentator at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. He noted that the group was heavily weighted toward developers, hedge fund managers and bankers, with hardly any representatives from Silicon Valley or academia. “I’m not sure how well the expertise on that list really matches up with some of the challenges facing the American economy. ” Kevin A. Hassett, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute, was also surprised at how few economists were selected. “Most campaigns tend to balance academics with business folks, like those on this list,” he said. As for whether the advisers will wield much influence, Mr. Hassett said, “It is pretty common for campaigns to have a long list of   business leaders who act as ‘advisers,’ but there is a large variation in how active they really are. ” The team will be led by Stephen Miller, the national director of policy for the campaign, and Dan Kowalski, the deputy director. Members are:  President and chief executive of the investment firm Paulson  Co. Mr. Paulson made billions of dollars by betting on the housing market’s collapse, right before the financial crisis, and has long been an advocate of relying on gold as a guide to monetary policy. __________ National finance chairman of the Trump campaign. He made a fortune at Goldman Sachs and later started Dune Capital Management, which bailed out a failed   housing lender. Renamed OneWest, the bank was criticized for its harsh foreclosure practices. In Hollywood, Mr. Mnuchin has produced movies, including “American Sniper” and “Mad Max: Fury Road. ” __________ Founder and chairman of Vornado Realty Trust, the largest owner of commercial real estate in New York City.  He and Mr. Trump have frequently competed for properties and have teamed up in deals. __________ An Oklahoma oil magnate. Mr. Hamm is the chief executive and founder of Continental Resources, which owns stakes in the   Bakken Formation. Last year, he sold Hiland Partners, an oil pipeline and gathering company, for $3 billion. He was Mitt Romney’s energy adviser during the 2012 presidential campaign. __________ The chief executive of Vector Group, a holding company of tobacco and real estate interests. Mr. Lorber was named by Mr. Trump as one of his best friends and once appeared on his television show “The Apprentice. ” __________ A   math whiz, the founder and president of Beal Bank, and an avid poker player.  Mr. Beal made a lot of money in the recession, buying distressed assets around the country. Mr. Beal, with the investor Carl Icahn, sued Mr. Trump for control of Trump Entertainment Resorts in Atlantic City after the company filed for bankruptcy. They failed, and Mr. Beal says now there are “no hard feelings. ”  He describes himself as a libertarian, and previously backed Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky. In an interview in June, he said he did not know much about Mr. Trump’s policy goals, but trusted him to manage the economy. __________ The founder and executive chairman of the Los   Colony Capital.  A longtime friend, Mr. Barrack previously worked with Mr. Trump and sold him the Plaza Hotel. Mr. Barrack has some government experience as a deputy under secretary for the Interior Department in the Reagan administration. He founded a “super PAC,” Rebuilding America Now, to support the Trump campaign. __________ The chief executive of the Federal Savings Bank. Mr. Calk has been critical of financial overhauls and regulations, including those advanced under the   legislation approved by Congress after the financial crisis and supported by President Obama. __________ A former chief economist at  Bear Stearns who later founded  an economic consulting firm. Mr. Malpass made his own bid for office in 2010, running to be New York’s Republican senatorial nominee. He has worked in Washington before, in the Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush administrations and as an analyst in Congress. A prominent contributor to The Wall Street Journal opinion pages, he helped lead an attack by conservatives of the Federal Reserve’s aggressive   program in 2010. __________ The former president and chief executive of the Nucor Corporation, one of the country’s largest steel makers.  Last year, Mr. DiMicco published “American Made: Why Making Things Will Return Us to Greatness,” which argues that a strong manufacturing sector is essential to maintaining a comfortable middle class. He has long maintained that every trade agreement has been a negative for the United States. __________ The founder and chief executive of Cerberus Capital Management, a private equity firm. Cerberus bought the failing carmaker Chrysler in 2007. Mr. Feinberg promised to revive Chrysler, but lost billions of dollars before it was restructured in a   bankruptcy in 2009. __________ A professor of economics and public policy in the business school at the University of California, Irvine and director of the documentary film “Death by China. ”  Mr. Navarro is one of a minority of academic economists who argue that free trade is bad for America. __________ A visiting fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation’s Project for Economic Growth.

","WASHINGTON (AP)  —   Donald Trump has a Plan B if he’s faced with a contested convention, and it involves the sort of outside groups that he’s called ”corrupt.” While the billionaire businessman might lock up the Republican presidential nomination in the next five weeks of voting, he and his allies are simultaneously undertaking a parallel effort in case he falls short. Outside groups, including one led by longtime Trump political ally Roger Stone, and a loose collection of colorful supporters such as ”Bikers for Trump” are organizing ahead of the July convention in Cleveland. They’re soliciting money to pay for their transportation and housing, and they’re already trying to influence the mood of the convention with a social media campaign saying that anything short of a Trump nomination would be ”stealing.” ”Our principle focus right now is Cleveland,” Stone said of his group, called Stop the Steal. ”We want to bring as large a contingent as possible to demonstrate the breadth of Trump’s appeal so that the party can see graphically what they’re going to lose if they hijack the nomination from him.” Stop the Steal and other groups are gaining steam even though Trump has insisted he wants no donor help for his bid and is beholden to no one. Super political action committees ”are a disaster, by the way, folks,” Trump said at a Republican debate in March. ”Very corrupt.” Stop the Steal is not technically a super PAC, but it operates under very similar rules. This past week, Trump’s lawyers sent the Federal Election Commission a letter renewing the campaign’s disavowal of groups using his ”name, image, likeness, or slogans in connection with soliciting contributions.” All the groups planning Cleveland activities repeatedly use his name in their literature. Trump set the stage for what the outside groups are doing by making provocative comments about the complex way Republicans pick a nominee  —   ”rigged,” he calls it. Voters weigh in, but each state has its own rules about what delegates go to the convention and how they must vote on a presidential candidate while they’re there. Stop the Steal and other Trump fans are pushing a similar message on social media and websites. ”The big steal is in full swing,” one online letter says, calling unfriendly delegates ”stooges.” The   Cleveland coalition includes We Will Walk, Bikers for Trump, Citizens for Trump and Women for Trump. Stone said the goal is to bring thousands of people to march peacefully in the streets. ”We are prepared to bring the Republican Party down if they mess with Trump and try to take it away from him by doing the dirty tricks,” said Paul Nagy, a New Hampshire Republican. He runs We Will Walk, a group that has collected more than 41, 000 online signatures of people who say Trump deserves the nomination. The public relations offensive is a counterpart to GOP rival Ted Cruz’s carefully crafted,   strategy of recruiting friendly delegates in hopes he can win if Trump falls short on the first ballot of voting. This weekend in Arizona, Cruz won another strategic victory over Trump, getting numerous friendly delegates elected to head to Cleveland while the Trump backers appeared to be virtually shut out. Those delegates are required to first vote for Trump at the convention because he won the state, but they could later switch their votes to Cruz. While Cruz is playing within the party’s rules, Trump’s claim that what Cruz is doing amounts to ”stealing” resonates with voters. In   after Cruz swept Colorado’s elected delegates,    mom Erin Behrens said she felt sick about what was happening to her candidate. So Stop the Steal helped her organize protests in the state. Stone and an ally, Greg Lewis, flew in to help Behrens answer email and arrange a rally. At the April 15 event in Denver, about 200 demonstrators waved banners that read ”Banana Republicans” and chanted ”Stop the Steal!” Behrens said in an interview last week that she’s continuing to organize Trump supporters in Colorado. ”If there’s funny business and they make it clear they’re going to not give it to Trump, Stop the Steal Cleveland will be one thing,” she said. ”But we will have protests, events across the United States. Count on it.” A good chunk of what the outside groups are doing now is fundraising. ”Bottom line we need to raise $262, 000 in the next two weeks,” Stop the Steal’s website says. ”If you can’t make it to Cleveland will you help those who can? Will you send $500, $200 or even $100 to this crucial effort?” A different   group, Great America PAC, also is raising money for a Cleveland effort. This one is led by William Doddridge, chief executive officer of the Jewelry Exchange. Its commercials warn that ”party elites” will try to seize the nomination from Trump at the convention and suggest that people stop that from happening by calling an 800 number and giving money. It needs the help. The group’s latest fundraising report, covering through the end of March, shows it is more than $600, 000 in debt. The super PAC can take unlimited contributions from individuals, corporations and unions. Trump’s lawyers have specifically asked it to cease operations. Stop the Steal isn’t a super PAC, the category of outside group that attracts the most ire from Trump, Stone said. But it’s a distinction without a difference. It is organized as a political nonprofit ”527” group that files periodic disclosure reports about its donors and spending with the Internal Revenue Service rather than the Federal Election Commission. Like an   super PAC, a 527 can take unlimited amounts of money from individuals, corporations and unions. ___, Associated Press writers Nicholas Riccardi in Denver and Jill Colvin in Washington contributed to this report.

","We are sometimes skeptical about Republican presidential contenders who embrace the   position late in life at a convenient moment, as Donald Trump did a few years ago when he was 64 years of age. Mitt Romney, for whom we have a great deal of respect, changed his mind, too, right around the time he started his journey from leadership of a liberal state to leadership of a conservative party. But sometimes Saul does fall off his ass, and there is more joy in Heaven. Donald Trump, however, does not seem to have thought this through. (Of course, we could write that about Trump and practically any issue.) In other words, Trump, who insists that he will surround himself with the best advisers in order to be thoroughly prepared for anything the presidency might throw at him, was completely unready to give a thoughtful answer to a question in a    controversy about which a great deal of intelligent and humane commentary has been published. He managed to damage his own campaign, the Republican party, and the   cause at a single go. That is one of the problems with his masquerading as a conservative, something he isn’t. He doesn’t understand conservatism or what conservatives think, and so he goes from moment to moment saying whatever he thinks will be of maximum benefit to himself in any given context. Punishment sounds tough, and tough is Trump’s brand. But whatever your position is on that approach, you should probably have figured it out well before you run for president as a purportedly   candidate. Trump likes to compare himself to Ronald Reagan, who also changed his mind over the years on some important issues, including abortion. But Reagan also had a long career as an activist and a governor before becoming the Republican   during which time he bothered to read a great deal of serious policy literature and to figure out what he actually believed and why. There were 16 long years between Reagan’s “A Time for Choosing” speech and his election to the presidency. Donald Trump was not a principled conservative activist 16 years ago, or 16 months ago. And you’d be a fool to believe that you can predict what position he’ll take 16 minutes from now, on abortion or anything else. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,25

[“I want those of you who have been with me from the beginning of this incredible journey to be the first to know that I’m with her,” Obama said in a web video released by the Clinton campaign.  Obama recalled his own   primary campaign against Clinton and congratulated her for making history. “I am fired up, and I cannot wait to get out there to campaign for Hillary,” he said. The video was released shortly after Bernie Sanders met with Obama at the White House. “Look, I know how hard this job can be. That’s why I know Hillary will be so good at it,” Obama said. “In fact, I don’t think there’s ever been someone so qualified to hold this office. ” Obama acknowledged that both Sanders and Clinton were both “patriots who love this country” “They share a vision for the America that we all believe in, an America that is hopeful, an America that is   an America that is strong and fair and gives every child the same chance as we had,” he said. “Those are the values that unite us as Democrats. Those are the values that make America great. Those are the values that are going to be tested in this election. ” According to the Clinton campaign, Obama will travel to Green Bay, Wisconsin, next Wednesday to campaign with Hillary Clinton.

27,27,6629,59944,82027,Where Hillary Clinton Fell Short,Atlantic,Andrew McGill,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,,"It now seems likely that Hillary Clinton will get fewer votes than Barack Obama did in 2012. More distressingly for Democrats, she fared worse in   cities that anchor swing states, including Detroit, Cleveland, and Milwaukee. To critics on the left, that’s evidence of a campaign that dragged its feet, and a candidate who took her base for granted. Her defeat, in their minds, was an unforced error. How Trump Could Wage a War on Scientific Expertise, But the numbers show something different. There’s no question Clinton faltered in some Democratic cities, but the gaps between her haul and Obama’s in those locations were modest. The vast majority of her deficit came instead from counties that Obama lost in 2012: They didn’t like him, but they really hated her. As of Thursday, ballot counts collected by the Atlas of U. S. Presidential Elections show Clinton received fewer votes than Obama did in 87 percent of U. S. counties. That sounds worse than it really is. Some of those counties are pretty small, and the remaining 11 percent include a few megacities, such as Los Angeles and Chicago. Let’s put it another way: Accounting for population density, she scored worse than Obama in areas that are home to roughly half the people who voted this year, and scored the same or better than Obama with the other half. Where did she fare the worst? Line them up, and it doesn’t look good —  they’re a bevy of heavily Democratic counties. With the exception of Macomb and Suffolk, Clinton still won all these counties. She just didn’t win them as decisively as Obama did. That hurt her: Counties, unlike most states, are not    and every vote counts toward the statewide total that determines who wins the electors. Clinton needed to run up the score in Democratic centers as high as she could to counter Trump’s overwhelming lead among rural voters. When she went to the liberal well, they didn’t give her the votes. But they didn’t cost her the election, either. Among the 2, 700 counties where Clinton got fewer votes than Obama did in 2012, she still held her own in most of the places her predecessor won, winning many of them and picking up 90 percent of his votes in the process. All told, she ended up with a 1. 8 million vote deficit compared with Obama in these communities. That seems like a lot. But that wasn’t her big problem. It’s in the regions Obama lost that Clinton felt the most pain. In red counties, she received only 84 percent of the president’s votes in 2012, finishing 2. 1 million behind. Even if Clinton matched Obama in turnout for every county he won that year, that wouldn’t erase her deep disadvantage in conservative areas that the president himself couldn’t clinch. Granted, things get a bit tricky in the swing states. In Wisconsin, Ohio, and Michigan, if Clinton had matched 2012’s turnout in   counties, she might have been able to pull out victories. But these states didn’t necessarily see Democrats stay home on Election Day. Rather, it seems likely that many Obama voters flipped to Trump. And Clinton’s critics miss an important point: She actually performed better than Obama did in nearly 400 counties. Some of these places are quite hefty,  . Here’s where she exceeded her predecessor the most: Clinton killed it in California (which still has 600, 000 ballots left to count, many of which will probably go Democratic, given the state’s blue status). And she performed very well, compared with Obama, in many of the country’s major population centers. If you factor in these successes, Clinton’s net turnout actually tops Obama’s in the areas that went Democratic four years ago. In the end, she beat Obama’s take by 120, 000 among those counties, with gains in the coasts canceling her   losses in the Rust Belt. That’s not a weak showing. “Democrats did better this time in places that were already blue  and did worse in places that were already red,” said Barry Burden, a   professor at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. “It sort of is a battle of the many versus the few. You add up those smaller rural places, and they were enough to swamp the bigger urban areas, and even suburban counties. ” Unfortunately for Democrats, Clinton won in all the wrong places. Her strong showing in diverse, dense counties will have a place in history. But because of the Electoral College, her surpluses in California didn’t help her compensate for deficiencies in Michigan. And because she was so deeply unpopular in conservative communities, her net turnout will still fall below Obama’s. There’s also the insurgent popularity of Trump himself, who gained 1. 5 million voters over Romney. Some of them were Democrats. So Clinton won the popular vote, but she lost the election she didn’t top her predecessor’s total, despite heavy turnout from places that liked him the most. Democrats will have to figure out how to capitalize on her successes —  while at the same time avoiding her defeats —  come 2020.",0,0,0,0,0,0,27
28,28,2669,106128,156697,Donald Trump deserves his frosty reception in Scotland,Guardian,Anthony Baxter,2016-06-24,2016.0,6.0,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/24/donald-trump-frosty-reception-scotland-broken-promises-golf,"As the Donald descended from the steps of Trump Force One and attempted to shield his wayward hair from the easterly winds sweeping across the Tarmac of Aberdeen airport, he would have expected a frosty reception. Trump, ignoring the   petition calling for him to be banned from the UK for “hate speech” is in Scotland as part of a whistlestop tour of his two Scottish golf courses. The first port of call will be Turnberry  —   now renamed Trump Turnberry  —   after an investment claimed by the Trump Organisation to be £200m. But it is at his Menie estate in Aberdeenshire where the Mexican flags are flying high. Michael Forbes and David Milne, who were among the residents Trump threatened with compulsory purchase orders when they refused to sell him their properties to make way for a luxury golf resort, have hoisted the flags in a show of solidarity with the people of Mexico. Trump, of course, has pledged to build a   wall along the Mexican border “very inexpensively” to stop “rapists and drug dealers” from entering the US if he becomes president. And as the residents of the Menie estate know only too well, Trump has form on walls. As I documented in my first Trump film, You’ve Been Trumped, at the crack of dawn one morning in 2010, the billionaire’s bulldozers sprang into action and began dumping thousands of tons of earth around the homes of local residents Susan Munro and David Milne, after the tycoon had branded their houses ugly. Trump’s builders (who had no planning permission for these works, according to the residents) had already been caught on camera, burying trees in an enormous hole next to the mounds of earth piled up to shield Forbes’s farm from the view of Trump’s golfers. Trump had blasted Forbes on national television for “living like a pig” and his working farm “a pigsty”. In many ways, Trump’s   development at the Menie estate is a microcosm of what’s been going on during his run for the White House. When Trump pledged to be the “jobs president” Scots were quick to remember his broken promises on jobs. Trump claimed he would create 6, 000 jobs through his golf course resort and spend £1bn building the “greatest luxury golf resort in the world”. In fact, no “resort” was ever built. Around 100 jobs have been created on the Menie estate and a single golf course is in operation, along with a   clubhouse. It is estimated he has spent less than 5% of the original investment pledged. Plans for a second golf course have yet to materialise  —   much to the relief of local residents who fear it would destroy another stretch of wild dunes. The   website PolitiFact has determined that Trump’s campaign statements are riddled with an astounding number of outright falsehoods. That’s hardly news to Forbes, who has the phrase “NO MORE TRUMP LIES” daubed on one of his farm sheds. Forbes has watched for more than a decade as the Trump claims and promises have come to nothing. The   hotel has never been built. The 1, 500 houses failed to materialise. Instead a golf course for the wealthy now stands between him and his salmon fishing boat, with Forbes complaining he is unable to access the beach to fish. Trump claimed his Menie estate golf course would be “environmentally perfect”. But in fact it destroyed the ability of the sand dunes to move and shift naturally, something that was highlighted by every credible environmental group in the land when his plans were first submitted. Trump also insists he has been a good neighbour. But local residents think otherwise. In April, a woman walking on the dunes near Trump’s golf course was charged by police and accused of “a disgusting and shameful act” by the Trump Organization. Her crime? Answering a call of nature. This incident shook local residents, who had hoped the police had learned lessons after spending years appearing to act like a private security force for Trump. I should know. The police arrested me and threw me in jail, for daring to ask why Molly Forbes who is now 92, had her water supply cut off by Trump’s bulldozers. The bullying of local residents and failure to deliver on economic promises are perhaps the main reasons why the billionaire’s popularity rating in Scotland is at rock bottom. Former first minister Alex Salmond, who once enthusiastically welcomed the Trump development, now says the billionaire “couldn’t get elected the dog catcher” in Scotland. And as Trump steps up the rhetoric in his campaign to be president, with ideas such as banning all Muslims from the US, it is little wonder that Robert Gordon University in Aberdeen finally saw sense and stripped him of the ludicrous honorary degree he received in 2010. While there has been endless debate about the many outrageous statements that Trump has made during the presidential campaign, the events at the Menie estate prove that what Trump says and what he does are two very different things. Here he used his money and access to power and the media to intimidate ordinary people he made outrageous promises to hoodwink the gullible (including, alas, the Scottish government) and he showed a breathtaking disdain for the environmental toll of his relentless pursuit of personal gain. It is a cautionary tale for Americans going to the ballot box in November, and for the people of Britain, who have lost, for ever, an irreplaceable part of our common natural heritage.",0,0,0,0,0,0,28

","       As she picked cotton and shucked corn in the fields of South Carolina with her parents, it never occurred to the young Virginia McLaurin that she might one day eat in the same restaurants as white people. And the notion that she would live to see the country elect a black president, and that one day she’d be invited to the White House and clasp his hands and dance with him for all the world to see? Well, McLaurin could not have imagined that even deep into her old age. And yet it happened  —   and was captured in a video released by the White House on Sunday night of McLaurin meeting the Obamas during a Black History Month celebration last week. Overnight, the    D. C. resident became an Internet sensation. But by lunchtime Monday, McLaurin still hadn’t seen the video herself. Her phone had begun ringing at 5 a. m. in her apartment, on the upper Northwest Washington block where she has lived since 1939. It was her grandson. He’d just seen her dancing with the president and the first lady on the news. “I didn’t know you were going to be on TV,” he said. “Neither did I,” she replied. She kept trying to catch a glimpse, but the phone never stopped ringing with calls from family and friends who’d seen the clip. Then finally, deep into the afternoon on Monday, McLaurin got to watch the moment that had made her famous. Her eyes were fixed on the iPhone in her lap, as she sat in a backroom of Busboys and Poets restaurant near U Street  —    in front of a mural of civil rights icons. Her mouth dropped open: There she was, dancing with her beloved president. She seemed almost as amazed by the technology that was allowing her to relive it all. “Where can I get one of these?” she asked about the smartphone video. “I wish this was mine. ” For a few hours over a lunch, she reflected on her life and those precious few minutes she had fulfilling a dream she didn’t even know to entertain until 2008. “I was so happy to meet the black president,” she said. “I was so happy to shake his hand, and his wife was so nice. It was the joy of my entire life. I can die smiling now. ” ‘This was white and this was black’ McLaurin was born in South Carolina in 1909 at a time when slavery was still a fresh memory and African American kids in the South didn’t go to school past eighth grade. She married young, just 13, a fact she’s bashful to share. She lived briefly with her husband in northern New Jersey before he was killed in a bar brawl, and she moved to Washington to be with her sister in 1939. She had two children  —   her son has since passed, and her daughter is 83 years old  —   and did domestic work for families in Silver Spring, Md. and managed a laundry shop when women weren’t allowed to handle the men’s suits. McLaurin still lives alone and does all her own housework, except for laundry because there are no machines in her unit. She has too many grandchildren to count, but she estimates them at about 50. Her grandkids’ grandchild has a kid. As a child growing up in the South, she said she didn’t imagine that there could ever be a world where white and black people were integrated. When the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. marched in Washington in 1963, she didn’t know whether his dream would ever be realized. “This was white and this was black. There were so many things we weren’t allowed to do, we were raised up like that,” she said. “I felt like it would always be that way. ” Still, she was never bitter  —   quite the opposite. People ask her all the time how she remains so positive. “I have nothing to do but be happy,” she says. But do you ever worry, they’ll ask. “Why? It ain’t gonna help. ” Deeply faithful, McLaurin attends a weekly Bible study, and she said it’s helped her stay upbeat and healthy. That, she said, and a diet of fried beans and peas. Other than a back surgery about 50 years ago, she hasn’t had any major health issues. “The Bible said a good laugh is the best medicine,” she said. “You don’t know who you’re going to have to look to before you leave this world, so you treat people how you want to be treated. Treat people nice and somebody will always treat you nice. ” ‘I could come to your house to make things easier’ She was watching “Judge Judy” at home last week when her friend, Deborah Menkart, called to tell her there was a good chance that they were going to the White House for a Black History Month celebration. A day or so later, it was confirmed that the next day at 3:30 p. m. they were going to the White House. McLaurin wanted to go shopping for a new dress and new shoes, but there wasn’t time. So she wore the electric blue suit she’d worn to her 103th birthday party where Marion Barry had been a surprise guest. She said she danced with him, too. Her granddaughter painted her nails a bright blue to match  —   something Michelle Obama noticed and complimented her on.    106   Virginia McLaurin watches the video of her with the Obamas on Feb 22, 2016 in Washington, DC. The video of McLaurin dancing with President and First Lady Obama last week at the White House went viral on the Internet. (Photo by Kate Patterson for The Washington Post)  In 2014, another friend had submitted a petition to the White House with a note from McLaurin. “I know you are a busy man, but I wish I could meet you,” she said. “I would love to meet you. I could come to your house to make things easier. I pray to the Lord that I would be able to meet you one day. ” But it wasn’t until Menkart, 59, put a call out on Facebook on behalf of her friend to visit the White House that it actually happened. Marco Davis, the deputy director of the administration’s Hispanics education initiative, saw her post and made the connections. The White House, on its official blog, wrote that Menkart had advocated for the meeting, citing McLaurin’s longtime volunteer work. For more than 20 years, she’s been a foster grandmother to city youth. When McLaurin sauntered into the Blue Room to meet the Obamas, she said she could barely contain her excitement. And now she’s  . At Busboys and Poets, owner Andy Shallal came to greet her and told her she was an inspiration to everyone. “Thank you for letting me in here,” she said.  “I remember where I came from,” she said. “It’s an honor,” he told her. “You made so many people light up. ”    106   Virginia McLaurin gets a kiss from Pastor Lionel Edmonds who just happened to be passing by and wanted to have his photo taken with her on Feb 22, 2016 in Washington, DC. A video of McLaurin dancing with President and First Lady Obama last week at the White House went viral on the Internet. (Photo by Kate Patterson for The Washington Post)  After lunch, McLaurin leaned on her gold cane and shuffled onto 14th Street, not too far from the historic Howard Theatre, where back in the day she used to go dancing, doing a move she called “picking cherries” and once partying with James Brown. She could barely walk a few steps without passersby recognizing her and asking if she’d join them for a photo. She beamed, and happily posed with everyone, thanking them for taking the time. “This is what it’s all about,” said the Rev. Lionel Edmonds, a pastor at Mount Lebanon Baptist Church, who stooped to kiss her forehead. ” She’s lived to this iconic moment. Every major event that has happened to the African American people she has witnessed. She’s a walking, talking icon. ” One of the first things McLaurin noticed when meeting Obama was how much he’d aged in office. But she still found him very handsome. “I wish I could have 30 minutes alone with him,” she said, mischievously. “Oh, you know how women think. ” Want more inspiring news and ideas to improve your life?

Clinton and Republican Donald J. Trump have 40 percent of the vote in the race for Colorado’s nine electoral votes, according to the   poll conducted Nov. 1 and Nov. 2 with 1, 125 registered voters in the state. [“This race has tightened, especially when you consider that in August the Clinton campaign was so confident that it announced it was pulling its ads money from the state to focus on other targets,” said Doug Kaplan, the managing partner of Gravis Marketing, the   polling company that executed the poll. The poll carries a 2. 9 percent margin of error with a 95 percent level of confidence.  Kaplan said, “Now the Clinton campaign is advertising in Colorado again and former president Bill Clinton made three stops in the state Friday. ” Libertarian Gary Johnson has the support of seven percent of the respondents, with Green Party nominee Dr. Jill Stein the choice of four percent. In the 2012 presidential race, President Barack Obama beat Republican W. Mitt Romney with 52 percent of the vote to Romney’s 46 percent. In the Senate race, Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet holds a slight edge over his GOP rival Daryl Glenn, with 47 percent of the voters to Glenn’s 44 percent —  just at the margin of error. The poll participants were asked a series of questions to gauge the mood of Colorado’s electorate. Sixty percent of the participants said the country was going in the wrong direction and 31 percent said it was going in the right direction.   percent of respondents said Obamacare was not a success and 33 percent said the president’s healthcare reform legislation was a success. Asked: Why do you think FBI Director James Comey chose to reopen the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server while Secretary of State after the agency recently uncovered thousands of emails on the laptop used by Clinton’s closest adviser?   percent of the respondents said Comey believed that he had found a significant development and 39 percent said the FBI director was trying to influence the election. Although the rebooting of the FBI investigation has dominated the news, 61 percent of respondents said it would not affect their vote, while 17 percent said it was “More Likely” to have an impact and 23 percent said it was “Less Likely. ” Asked: How concerned are you that if Hillary Clinton were elected President her current controversies and scandals will continue to be a central focus of her Presidency and detract from her ability to lead the country? Sixty percent of the respondents said they were concerned, broken down as 47 percent saying they were “Very Concerned” and 15 percent saying they “Concerned. ” Seventeen percent said they were “Not Concerned at All” and 19 percent said they were “Not Very Concerned. ” The poll was conducted using interactive voice response polling and an internet panel of cell phone users with results weighted to match a proprietary turnout model.   percent of the respondents said they had already voted.

31,31,6483,6483,24782,Houses of Worship Poised to Serve as Trump-Era Immigrant Sanctuaries - The New York Times,New York Times,Laurie Goodstein,2016-12-28,2016.0,12.0,,"PHILADELPHIA  —   Tucked one floor below the majestic Gothic sanctuary of Arch Street United Methodist Church, Javier Flores Garcia sleeps on a cot in a basement   classroom that church members have outfitted with a microwave, a compact refrigerator and a television. Mr. Flores, an arborist, longs for the open air, but does not dare set foot outside. He was supposed to report to the immigration authorities last month to be deported to his homeland, Mexico, but one day before his report date, he took refuge in the church. His family is why he is fighting to remain, and when they visited him in the church recently, his    son, Javier Jr. parked on his lap. The boy often refuses to leave his father’s side, and has ended up staying for days with him in the church. On Christmas Day, Mr. Flores had been there six weeks. This downtown church is one of 450 houses of worship in the United States that have offered to provide sanctuary or other assistance to undocumented immigrants, according to leaders of the Sanctuary Movement. (Few congregations have the space and fortitude to risk harboring immigrants indefinitely, so others are lining up to contribute money, legal aid, food, child care or transportation.) The congregations joining this network have more than doubled since the election of Donald J. Trump  —   a rapid rebuttal to Mr. Trump’s postelection promise to deport two million to three million unauthorized immigrants who he said have been convicted of crimes. Protecting immigrants is shaping up to be a priority of the religious left, an amorphous collection of people and groups reflecting many faiths and ethnicities. It has been jolted into action by Mr. Trump’s victory and his selection of an attorney general nominee who supports a crackdown on immigrants. “Jesus said we are to provide hospitality to the stranger,” said the Rev. Robin Hynicka, Arch Street’s pastor, citing Matthew 25, in which Jesus instructs his followers to feed, house and clothe “the least of these,” the poor and vulnerable. “That’s exactly what we were asked by Javier, to provide sanctuary. And of course, we said yes,” he added. Mr. Hynicka spoke in his chilly upstairs office at the church, which has 375 members. The heat worked better in the basement fellowship hall, where up to 30 homeless people take shelter on winter nights. This church is accustomed to mobilizing for social causes, from gay marriage to fights against casino gambling and for an increase in the minimum wage. Five years ago, the church joined the New Sanctuary Movement of Philadelphia, but Mr. Flores is the first person the church has taken in. On this night, his children excitedly brought Mr. Flores stray pieces of candy that volunteers were stuffing into piñatas for a party later. Mr. Flores and his longtime partner, Alma Lopez, have two children: Javier Jr. and Yael, age 2. He has also been a father to Ms. Lopez’s daughter, Adamaris, age 12, since she was abandoned as an infant by her birth father. All were born in the United States. The family’s home is two bus rides away from the church. Ms. Lopez, sucking on a lollipop, said having the family return to Mexico is not a solution: “We want a better future for our children. The situation in Mexico is very bad. There’s no work, no good school. Here, we have a future. ” The federal immigration authorities say Mr. Flores has a long history of violations: He was apprehended nine times between 1997 and 2002 trying to cross the border. He   and was ordered removed by a judge in 2007. He   twice in 2014 and served prison sentences for illegal   a criminal felony conviction. Last year his children saw him taken away by the authorities, and it took a toll. While Mr. Flores was in detention this year, Adamaris attempted suicide in April, drinking a bottle of rubbing alcohol. She was hospitalized for nine days. Immigration officials released Mr. Flores for 90 days to prepare his family for deportation. Sanctuary was his last hope. “My only crime is coming back,” said Mr. Flores, who wears a   ankle bracelet. The sanctuary movement in the United States is not new. American churches offered sanctuary to soldiers who refused to serve in the Vietnam War. And in the 1980s, congregations opened their doors to Central Americans fleeing wars in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. The movement was revived in 2006 and grew during President Obama’s two terms, said the Rev. Alexia Salvatierra, a pastor in the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. At least 2. 5 million people were deported during Mr. Obama’s time in office, earning him the nickname “deporter in chief. ” One big change from the 1980s, Pastor Salvatierra said, is that now, thousands of Latino churches and their clergies are also involved in protecting immigrants  —   frequently their own members and often quietly. In the ’80s, mostly white, Protestant churches led the way. “We’re in a different universe now. We don’t need the white people to rescue us, thank you very much. We need to be in partnership,” she said in an interview, before heading off to train sanctuary workers at a multiethnic church in downtown Los Angeles. She expected 25 people, but 150 signed up. But some see sanctuary as misguided, or naïve. Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, which supports tighter controls on immigration, said she understood that churches had sympathy for people facing deportation. “But I find myself wishing that they had as much sympathy for other parishioners they have who are adversely affected by illegal immigration” because of jobs, higher taxes or crime. Churches, schools and hospitals are considered “sensitive locations,” according to  Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Immigration officers are supposed to avoid those locations, unless they have advance approval from a supervisor or face “exigent circumstances” that require immediate action, said Jennifer Elzea, an agency spokeswoman. Religious leaders are preparing for the possibility that this could change under President Trump. Auburn Seminary in New York City, which trains religious leaders on the left, convened a postelection “Long Game Faith Summit” this month, and invited the Rev. Alison Harrington from Tucson to give workshops on sanctuary. “We can’t assume that churches and houses of worship will remain safe locations,” said Ms. Harrington, senior pastor at Southside Presbyterian Church, long a hub for sanctuary work. Sanctuary workers in the ’80s organized a sort of “underground railroad” to move immigrants from dangerous regions to safer ones, and that may have to be reactivated, she told her workshop. In considering whether to offer sanctuary, congregations look for immigrants with viable cases and sympathetic stories. Mr. Flores was the victim of a knife attack outside Philadelphia in 2004 and gave the police testimony that resulted in the attackers’ arrests. He has applied for a U Visa, given to crime victims, said his lawyer. In Denver this month, the Mountain View Friends Meeting, a Quaker church, took in a woman from Peru who worked for years in a nursing home using fake papers, pleaded to a felony, paid $12, 000 in back taxes and served four years on probation, said Jennifer Piper, interfaith organizer with the American Friends Service Committee and coordinator for the Metro Denver Sanctuary Coalition. The Peruvian woman has two children, ages 8 and 1, who are both American citizens. There are about 11 people in sanctuary in churches in New York now, said the Rev. Donna Schaper, senior minister of Judson Memorial Church, which is sheltering one of them. These immigrants did not commit violent crimes, she said, and many, like the woman in Denver, paid their penalties and now face double jeopardy. Ms. Schaper said that these are hardly the Mexican “rapists” whom Mr. Trump has said he will deport. “We are talking mostly about   crime. Faking credit cards. Faking IDs. Many of these people are quite middle class and well educated,” she said, and they are not only Latinos, but also Chinese, Russians, Pakistanis and many others. For some churches, the immigrants at risk are their own parishioners. Robert W. McElroy, Roman Catholic bishop of San Diego, recently told a Catholic immigration conference, “It is unthinkable that we will stand by while more than 10 percent of our flock is ripped from our midst and deported. ” The Episcopal Diocese of Los Angeles recently declared itself a “sanctuary diocese” and called for “holy resistance” to Mr. Trump’s immigration plans. The   Conference of the United Methodist Church also proclaimed support for sanctuary efforts. And when its rabbis convene in February, the Jewish group T’ruah: The Rabbinic Call for Human Rights will offer training on how to turn synagogues into sanctuary congregations. Before the piñata party at the Arch Street church, there was a ritual called Las Posadas, a   of the search for shelter by Mary and Joseph. Visitors collected outside the sanctuary doors and sang verses pleading to be let in. Church members responded from inside. Mr. Flores and his family were inside, of course. “What better work for the church to do,” said the minister, Mr. Hynicka, his arm around them, “than to provide what we know God gives us, our heartfelt commitment to family, whether that family comes from Mexico, or from Philadelphia, or wherever. ’’",0,0,0,0,0,0,31
32,32,31748,31787,50553,Trump’s GOP opponents left too much to chance,CNN,Kevin Madden,2017-01-06,2017.0,1.0,," (CNN) I have worked on three Republican presidential campaigns, and they all had one common strategic imperative: When it comes to defining your opponent, don’t leave anything to chance. For some reason, Donald Trump’s primary opponents decided to challenge this rule. The Jeb Bush campaign offered a case study on this. Early in the campaign, when NBC’s Chuck Todd asked where he got his military advice, Trump responded: ”I watch the shows.” It’s hard to think of a more disqualifying remark coming from a candidate in a Republican presidential primary.  As part of my work offering   commentary, I regularly talked to communications and political staff on the GOP campaigns. When I received a routine updates from Bush’s press shop that merely pointed out Trump’s remarks in an ”in case you missed it” type of way, I was taken aback. Why wasn’t the campaign against Trump more forceful, more sustained? I pressed Bush’s aides to hit Trump for learning about the military on TV, but got nowhere.  My main advice to Bush’s campaign and others battling Trump: Attack his lack of experience and even basic understanding of national security issues. This was a glaring weakness.  A very public effort to exploit it would require their constant attention, given Trump’s domination of media coverage. Where was the long line of national security experts? What were the advertising plans? I expected to hear back from Bush’s campaign with a confident, almost gleeful readout of the plan they were hatching to crush Trump for making this remark. Crickets. Nothing. As a result, the moment  —   the opportunity  —   quickly passed. The media turned its attention to Trump flogging Bush, the opponent he dubbed ”low energy.” Months later, it still boggles my mind that the Bush campaign  —   and all the rest  —   let that opening pass. It was a telling sign. Perhaps they thought the media would do their work for them. Perhaps they feared Trump’s retaliation.  Whatever the reason, Trump’s Republican opponents failed to define him. They broke the rule.  They left it to chance.",0,0,0,0,0,0,32
33,33,25220,128682,192855,Trump sees Japan’s Abe as ally in push back against China: adviser,Reuters,Tim Kelly,2016-11-11,2016.0,11.0,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-japan-idUSKBN1360IU  ," U. S.   Donald Trump’s meeting next week with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe may mark the start of talks to garner Japan’s support for a push back against China’s growing influence in Asia, a security adviser to Trump said. In the face of a rising China and a volatile North Korea, Trump’s campaign comments, including a demand that Japan pay more for the upkeep of U. S. forces on its soil, have worried Tokyo about a rift in a security alliance with Washington that has been the bedrock of its defense since World War Two. A tougher stance against China, however, and a call for Japan to play a bigger security role through a   axis would fit with Abe’s hawkish policies that include allowing the military to operate more freely overseas. Abe will meet Trump in New York on Thursday before going to the   Economic Cooperation summit in Peru. Trump was looking to Japan ”to play a more active role in Asia” the adviser, who declined to be identified because he was not authorized to talk to the media, told Reuters. Abe, he added, was ”a uniquely placed figure to offer leadership in the alliance”. Senior U. S. Navy commanders have said they would welcome joint air and sea patrols with Japan’s military in the disputed South China Sea, where the construction of island bases is extending Beijing’s influence. Tokyo has balked at direct provocation of its neighbor, choosing instead to assist nations in the region with disputes with China, such as the Philippines.  Trump, in his first 100 days in office, would end budget sequestration that mandates spending, including cuts in military outlays, and submit a budget that would fund construction of dozens of new warships, the adviser said.  It would ”send a message to Beijing as well as allies Japan and South Korea and other nations that the U. S. is intent on being in (Asia) for a long time” he said. However, current U. S. officials warn it would be difficult to build and absorb new warships. ”Ships can’t be built overnight,” a U. S. defense official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. ”The larger concern is how they would be funded and how they would be manned.”  The official said that even if the funds were available, it would be necessary to find shipyards and skilled workers to build the ships.  Ending sequestration is also easier said than done, requiring the approval of Congress, where the support would be needed of Democrats staunchly opposed to giving the Pentagon more money without also spending more on social programs. Trump would also need to overcome the reservations of fiscally conscious “Freedom Caucus” Republicans, who oppose increasing government spending, including at the Pentagon.  The Trump adviser said the   would want to allay any ”unfounded” concerns Abe may have and affirm his commitment to their countries’ security alliance. ”This is going to be a respectful conversation.”  Potential friction between the two countries, however, exists over how much Tokyo pays for the deployment of U. S. forces in Japan. Japan says the funding it provides, which covers three quarters of the cost, is enough. ”We are bearing the burden for what we should bear,” Japanese Minister of Defense Tomomi Inada told reporters in Tokyo on Friday, Kyodo news reported. Abe knows little about Trump, and in New York is likely to want to begin building a relationship that could yield a common world view, a person who knows the prime minister said. ”He has proven to be able to get along with fairly edgy people,” he said.

34,34,16759,16760,35497,Exclusive – Meet the Many for Whom Donald Trump is Their Voice: Thousands Rally in Virginia - Breitbart,Breitbart,Julia Hahn,2016-08-21,2016.0,8.0,,"FREDERICKSBURG, VA  —   Donald Trump addressed a crowd of more than 3, 000 people at the Fredericksburg Expo and Conference Center in Virginia on Saturday evening. [Prior to Trump’s address, Breitbart News caught up with many rally attendees  —   which included women, veterans, black Americans, Hispanic Americans, immigrants, seniors and millennials  —   and asked why they are supporting Trump.  The responses amongst a diverse group of Trump supporters were overwhelming: “he’s my voice,” “I need relief,” “we need change,” “we need to turn this country around,” “he believes in this country,” the supporters explained. Anna, who immigrated to the United States from Peru, told Breitbart, “I liked him from day one. He speaks his mind. He’s my voice. I felt that way from day one. ” Anna’s husband, Butch, was a Ted Cruz supporter during the primary, but said that once Trump became the nominee, he didn’t have to think twice about whom he’d support in the general election. “The people who are #NeverTrump are for Hillary Clinton,” Butch explained. “I don’t know how you could be for anyone but Trump. ” Anna said that she did not think Hillary Clinton would be good for American women. “Hillary Clinton is for Hillary Clinton. That’s the only woman she supports,” Anna said. “I’m a Latina for Trump!” At this point, another woman —  an immigrant from Ecuador —   who was standing nearby, but did not know Anna and Butch enthusiastically chimed in: “Trump’s honest! He says the truth! Hillary’s supposed to be in jail! She’s lying to the country. Mentirosa! Mentirosa! [Spanish for ‘liar’]” Anna laughed and joined in on the woman’s chant: “Mentirosa! Mentirosa! Liar!” “Hillary is a liar!” the woman from Ecuador said waving her Make America Great Again sign. “I never liked her!” Danny Prawatsrichai, who immigrated to the U. S. from Thailand, said: “I like the way he talks. I want to see change. People need jobs. We need change. Trump is a true man. I want him to win. ” Prawatsrichai said that he believed Trump was a more genuine person than Hillary Clinton. “I hate her. Trump is good  —   he is a good man. I know this in my heart. That’s the truth. We need him to win. ”  Sam, a black American from Virginia, told Breitbart that Trump “is our voice. ” “Donald Trump is going to put America’s interests first,” Sam said. “I mean, let’s face it, he’s giving more to us than we’re giving to him. We don’t have a voice. He is our voice. ” Sam explained that he was particularly bothered by the financial dealings of the Clinton Foundation. “Trace the money,” Sam said. “Hillary’s got so many sins that she has to spend the rest of her life on her knees praying she gets into heaven. ” Kelly Deleski said she supports Trump because he will better represent the interests of American women. “We need to defeat Hillary,” Deleski explained. “She is not representative of America, of women, of military, or of anything that I hold dear to my heart. She’s got all these Middle Eastern donations that are coming from countries that suppress women. I don’t know how she can say she’s for women when she’s taking donations from Middle Eastern countries that suppress women and deny women their rights. ” Pam, a nurse from Fredericksburg, seemed to echo this sentiment. “She offends me in that for being such a ‘liberated woman,’ she sure depends on men to take care of her,” Pam said. “I think she is a liar and a thief. I always thought so. I remember when we went through all of the scandals with Whitewater and Vince Foster. I was young —  18, 19 years old —   and was a political junkie  …     I didn’t like her then, and I don’t trust her now. ” Pam explained that, in her view, Trump represents the “change candidate”: “If I want any sort of change, I have to do something about it, and I have to vote for Trump  …     He’s right when he says, ‘What have you got to lose?’ That’s not something he should just be saying to African Americans and inner city people, that’s what you should be saying to everybody because everybody is in the same boat. We haven’t had a raise in years, we’re working our butts off, we’ve got to pick up overtime just to make it. It’s such bull. ” “If he does half of the things he says he’s going to do, this country is going to be a better place and I’m going to be in better shape,” Pam said, noting specifically that, as a nurse, she preferred Trump’s health care policy to that of Hillary Clinton.  Chris, a millennial from Northern Virginia, said that he supports Trump because of his immigration and economic policies. “I truly believe we need to build a wall to keep all of the illegal immigrants out,” Chris said. “The reason I’m supporting Donald Trump is because he’s not like the other establishment politicians like Hillary Clinton or Marco Rubio. ” Chris’ friend, Ben Johnson, chimed in: “I didn’t support [Rubio] either. He was weak. He wasn’t strong like Donald Trump is. He was ‘Little Marco’. You can tell that Donald Trump believes what he says. ” “There are tons of people our age supporting Donald Trump,” Johnson added. “Almost everyone I know our age is supporting Donald Trump. ” Chris nodded in agreement, noting: “I worked at    for nine months and nearly all of my   were supporting Donald Trump. ”  “Hillary is so untrustworthy. I hate the way that she sells out to Wall Street,” said Kyle, a college student at the University of Mary Washington who described himself as a “moderate conservative”. Kyle said that because he is a Republican he was always planning on supporting the Republican nominee regardless of who had won the nomination. “I can’t stand the whole email fiasco,” Kyle added. “My dad is a government worker and he told me that if he ever were to send classified emails over a private server, he’d be in jail. But apparently it’s fine for Hillary to do it because she’s above the law. ” John, an immigrant and former Marine officer, who attended the rally with his daughter, a  . S. citizen who works in Virginia, explained that he is supporting Trump because, “he shares my basic values: he’s   and he’s   —   amendment  …     I’m a Republican and I support the Republican Party. ” John said that he felt Clinton lacked the temperament to be president: “I used to be a Marine officer. One of my friends was a fighter jet pilot that flew Air Force One during President Bill Clinton, and he said that Hillary had a hot temper. She was terrible. In the media, she looks nice, she smiles, but on Air Force One she would argue and shout. He said it was terrible. I think Hillary is a liar. ” “We’ve got to save our country for our grandkids,” Ed Veazey said when asked why he and his wife were there supporting Trump. Veazey, a former submariner, explained that he and his wife, Joy, had four children and ten grandchildren, and that it is out of concern for them and their futures that the Veazeys are supporting Trump.  Mike Andersen, a former Marine from Southern Maryland, said that he was voting for Trump because, “I’m a small business owner and I need relief. ” When asked what he thought of Hillary Clinton, Anderson said just one word: “Liar. ” “[Trump] stands up and tells the truth,” said one veteran from Northern Virginia, who attended the rally with his sister and father, who is also a veteran. “Trump’s not afraid to tell the truth. And I think a lot of politicians, both Republicans and Democrats, lie  …     I was blind to the whole situation before Trump came along. [Before Trump] I had thought Paul Ryan was okay, but now I’m against the establishment altogether. I don’t even consider Donald Trump a Republican —  I consider him an Independent. I’m not voting Republican or Democrat, I’m voting for Trump. ” “We’re vets and Trump is sympathetic to veterans,” he added. “I don’t think Hillary could care less about vets. I don’t think she cares about anything but herself. ” “We need to turn this country around,” the man’s father added. “Trump believes in America and he’s the only one who can save our country. He’s a good man. He doesn’t have to do this. They’ve been calling him names. He’s doing it because he believes in this country. ”  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,34
35,35,5557,58867,80682,Hillary Clinton Shouldn’t Be Faulted for Her Relentless Preparation,Atlantic,Clare Foran,2016-09-27,2016.0,9.0,,"        For us to continue writing great stories, we need to display ads.             Please select the extension that is blocking ads.     Please follow the steps below, Hillary Clinton should not be penalized for preparing extensively to run for president. At the first   debate on Monday, the Democratic nominee demonstrated a more nuanced understanding of complex problems facing the country than Donald Trump did. That’s not entirely surprising given that she reportedly devoted more time to “homework, research, and rehearsals” than her Republican rival had. Yet while voters should expect presidential candidates to prepare for the challenges of campaigning and the presidency, it didn’t take long for Clinton’s effort to become a focus of   criticism.   “She obviously was overprepared, and she wanted to make sure we heard every single scripted moment, including the snarky ones, that she had prepared to say,” Trump’s campaign manager Kellyanne Conway told CNN Tuesday morning. It’s not just partisans who have been critical of the way Clinton’s preparation played out on the debate stage. “Hillary Clinton was at times, even, you could argue, overprepared,” Chuck Todd, the moderator of NBC’s Meet the Press, commented in his analysis of the debate, concluding that “her opening statement must have had 15 policy proposals within that two minutes. ” ‘Allowing America to Confront Its Tortured Racial Past’ Valuing preparation in a presidential candidate is not a partisan position and should not be controversial. It’s even possible to criticize what Clinton said on stage while acknowledging that preparation reflects well on her as a candidate. So why have critics been so quick to find fault? The idea that Clinton was overprepared feeds into negative perceptions of her as inauthentic. That’s clearly the narrative the Trump campaign wants to promote. It’s also not hard to see sexism at work in subtle ways when Clinton is effectively being criticized for her ambition. There are, of course, more gracious interpretations of the   commentary: that “overprepared” is merely a shorthand for Clinton’s wonky style of political communication, and not a criticism of the effort she took to prepare. But regardless of intent, claims that Clinton was overly prepared risk leaving the impression that the best politicians are ones who are born with the skill it takes to win elected office —  or those the public perceives as effortlessly talented —  and not the ones who have to work hard to win. Clinton readily admits that campaigning doesn’t come easily for her. “I am not a natural politician, in case you haven’t noticed, like my husband or President Obama,” she said at a Democratic primary debate in March. At the debate on Monday, she framed the effort she has undertaken to run for president in a positive light. “I think Donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate, and yes, I did,” Clinton said, after Trump commented that he had “been all over the place” while she had “decided to stay home. ” Clinton added: “You know what else I prepared for? I prepared to be president. And I think that’s a good thing. ” It’s remarkable and more than a little depressing that the Democratic nominee has to explain that advanced preparation is an asset for such a   event. The reason she has to explain that, though, is that Clinton is acutely aware that critics dislike what her preparation signals: a relentless determination to win. Determination is not the same as preparation. Trump could be extremely determined to become president, but unwilling to do anything to prepare. Yet the two qualities seem to be conflated in the minds of some voters. And when assigned to Clinton, voters sometimes describe both qualities as negative. At a focus group of undecided voters moderated by Republican strategist Frank Luntz earlier this month, a number of participants described Clinton as determined to do whatever it takes to win, and judged her for it. “You don’t ever select the person who wants the position for that position, and I think that’s the case with Hillary Clinton,” one woman said, adding: “She wants it so much she’ll say anything, she’ll do anything. ” Clinton’s ambition was framed as evidence of entitlement and selfishness. “All she knows is she wants to be president, she deserves to be president,” another woman said. One man added: “This is all she knows, this is her entire life, this is not something she’s doing for the country. ” For voters who see the political system as thoroughly broken, Clinton’s political experience does not qualify her to become president so much as it disqualifies her. Trump’s lack of experience, by comparison, makes him more suited to the presidency in the eyes of his supporters. There is an irony to all this: Running for office necessarily means a person aspires to be a professional politician, yet voters require prospective officeholders to denounce the political system at every turn. Doing so is held up as proof of authenticity and qualification for the job. That’s not to say that there aren’t candidates who want to run for office because they want to change the system. But it is disingenuous to pretend, as so many candidates do, that they are not themselves part of “the system” already. Clinton actually acknowledges that she is a politician and takes the job seriously. That acknowledgment in and of itself is authentic, though she is rarely, if ever, described as such. It’s not inherently sexist to find fault with ambition. But it is likely that some of the criticism Clinton faces stems from her willingness to transgress expectations of women. In 2013, Stanford University sociologist Marianne Cooper wrote in the Harvard Business Review that “  women experience social backlash because their very success —  and specifically the behaviors that created that success —  violates our expectations about how women are supposed to behave. Women are experienced to be nice, warm, friendly, and nurturing. Thus, if a woman acts assertively or competitively . .. she is deviating from the social script that dictates how she ‘should’ behave. ” This backlash is likely at play to some extent in negative assessments of Clinton. Preparation suggests determination, assertiveness, and a desire for power that does not mesh with   gender stereotypes.   It is impossible to separate criticism over Clinton’s ambition from the vast gender disparities that exist in politics. There is no feasible way that the first woman to win a   nomination could be a “natural” at trying to win an office that only men have won there’s nothing effortless about trying to break a   mold in American politics. So it’s not hard to see why Clinton might feel pressure to demonstrate that she’s more prepared than her male counterpart —  to prove that she’s ready for a position that American voters never before deemed a woman adequately qualified to hold. Whatever the outcome of the election, criticism on the campaign trail has consequences. In this case, the criticism that Clinton faces risks reinforcing a standard that’s impossible to live up to, and one that could discourage women and men alike from seeking elected office.",0,0,0,0,0,0,35
36,36,18942,72350,105663, Clinton Campaign Sees Its Coalition Growing After Super Tuesday,Buzzfeed News,Ruby Cramer,2016-03-04,2016.0,3.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20160304054855/https://www.buzzfeed.com/rubycramer/clinton-campaign-sees-their-coalition-growing-after-super-tu
"," MIAMI  —   As the final tallies came in on Super Tuesday, even after Hillary Clinton had already secured massive victories among people of color in the Southern states, campaign aides were still keeping special watch over results from the very rural and very white wedge of land that makes up Virginia’s 9th Congressional District. The southwestern corner of the state, encompassing 20 full counties and parts of two others, is comprised almost exclusively of white voters. And Clinton  —   after faltering early against Bernie Sanders in mostly white states like Iowa and New Hampshire  —   appeared to be winning. If she could hold her lead there, aides argued inside the dark Miami event space where the candidate held her victory rally, it would be evidence of a broadening, diverse,   Clinton coalition. By night’s end, Clinton clinched seven states, one U. S. territory, and a lead of more than 180 pledged delegates over Sanders, campaign manager Robby Mook noted in a   memo released by the campaign on Wednesday. The delegate margin, Mook argues, is larger than any Barack Obama had in the last Democratic primary  —   making it “increasingly difficult and eventually mathematically impossible for Sanders to catch up. ” But on Tuesday, aides seemed particularly interested in places like Virginia’s 9th District, where they saw signs of growth in their base of older voters, women, and people of color. Clinton ultimately won the area, and by a margin of nearly 10% according to AP results in the district’s 20 counties. “We’re very encouraged to see that not only is she performing well in the places that she did all along, but we’re seeing good results in rural, largely white parts of the state of Virginia,” said campaign spokesman Brian Fallon, who huddled with reporters here after Clinton’s speech to discuss Super Tuesday results. The “meaningful development,” he argued, was as much a promising sign for future Democratic contests, such as in Rust Belt states like Ohio and Michigan, as for the general election. “That’s a good indication that we are broadening the coalition that we built in the first four states,” Fallon said. “We have the makings of a   diverse coalition that could not just power her to the nomination, but also make for a winning coalition in a general election. ” (Virginia’s 9th District is not without its complications: Once Democratic, the district has leaned Republican the last few cycles  —   and in a potential general election against Trump, who did well in there with significantly higher turnout, Clinton may face difficulties with Rust Belt voters while performing better with other voters.) The campaign moves into the next set of contests  —   held on March 5, March 8, and March 15  —   with a strong Super Tuesday showing among voting blocs already supporting Clinton in the Democratic primary. Where Obama in 2008 claimed young voters, liberals, and people of color during the Democratic primary, Clinton appears to be building a base of older voters, people of color, and women. Across those states, black voters supported Clinton widely. (In Alabama, the margin was as large as 93% to 5%.) Clinton also did better with Latino voters, particularly in Texas. Fallon acknowledged that the campaign has “room to grow,” particularly among young people, who have rallied in early contests behind Sanders and the   Street political revolution at the center of his campaign. Clinton has refined her pitch to young people, promising to be “for them,” even if they aren’t “for her” right now. Campaign aides hope to grow the support they’ve already seen among young people of color. “We want to expand and build off of that,” Fallon said. In the campaign memo released Wednesday, highlighting the vast margins in Southern states, Mook argues that Sanders can not recover from the delegate lead Clinton has already amassed. Through strategic targeting, Mook says, Clinton may, for instance, be able to claim more delegates from just one congressional district, Alabama’s 7th, than Sanders will from his victory in the state of Oklahoma. Clinton aides questioned Sanders’ larger strategy, saying the Vermont senator has not been able to expand his support among people of color  —   even in states such as South Carolina, where he spent $2 million on ads and sent 200 paid staffers. (Clinton won by a nearly   margin, and 68 points among black voters.) Ahead of Super Tuesday, the Sanders campaign targeted five states as    —   Vermont, Minnesota, Oklahoma, Colorado, and Massachusetts  —   ceding the most diverse states to Clinton. “You can’t win the nomination writing off the most diverse states,” said Fallon. “If you’re seriously going to vie for the Democratic nomination, you need to be able to win states like here in Florida  —   and there’s not been a result yet where the Sanders campaign has won in a state that gives you confidence to think that they will seriously vie in a state like Florida. ” “So that’s just true of the Democratic nomination,” Fallon said, “to say nothing of the coalition you would need in a general election. ” Sanders aides recognize the problems they face going forward. The morning after Super Tuesday, at a breakfast with reporters, top strategist Tad Devine said the campaign would be working harder to introduce Sanders to people of color in the South. “We think we can do a lot better, and this is why: because Bernie has an incredible personal story to tell about his activism in the civil rights movement,” Devine said. “We think that as they get to know him better  —   understand where he comes from and what he’s saying  —   we think we’re gonna do better. ” Still, in the same breath, Devine also said the campaign is looking forward to contests in the Midwest  —   friendlier terrain for Sanders. “The experience of communities in places like Michigan will perhaps make Bernie’s message on economics a much more powerful and resonant message,” he told reporters. On the other side, Clinton aides see an important difference in the way the two campaigns are approaching voters across the map. Put by Fallon: “We are running a truly national campaign,” Evan   contributed reporting from Vermont.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,36

","Trump, a prolific tweeter with about 15 million followers, needed six posts, each limited to 140 characters, to get out his message. “The U.

Trump made vowing to keep Carrier in the country and returning other   manufacturing jobs to the economically challenged Midwest a major part of his successful presidential campaign.

"," Hillary Clinton’s official campaign platform is now twice as long as “Hamlet”:   thousand six hundred   words of policy ideas. One hundred   pages. And growing. But, at its heart, this wordy list amounts to a statement of Clinton’s confidence in two things. The status quo. And the federal bureaucracy. The other two candidates left in this presidential race want to overhaul American government. Clinton mainly wants to tinker with its parts. In many cases, her plans involve adding small  —   but intricate  —   new tasks for the bureaucracy, designed to make government smarter, more generous and more just. To crack down on Wall Street, for instance, Clinton would expand a particular regulatory form. The form already is 42 pages long and can require up to 300 hours to fill out. If Congress doesn’t overhaul immigration, Clinton’s plan is to allow undocumented residents to walk into local federal offices and ask for help.   bureaucrats  —   armed with guidelines that nobody has written yet  —   would make millions of new decisions about who can stay. This approach says a lot about Clinton’s worldview, after 23 years in and around Washington. To her, complexity is realism. Clinton says she simply can’t make the simple, grand promises of her rivals  —   free college tuition, a big, beautiful, free wall. Instead, she skips ahead to what policy looks like the way it’s actually been done: complicated, ugly and in small steps. “It’s all incremental. It’s a lot of small ball,” said Michael Tanner of the libertarian Cato Institute. “But it’s incrementally increasing the size and cost of government. It’s all in one direction. ” If Clinton wins the Democratic nomination, this may turn out to be the perfect election to be a wonk  —   because of who she’d be running against. If Clinton treats policymaking like watchmaking  —   a lot of whirring, tiny, hidden gears  —   the Republican Party’s presumptive nominee, Donald Trump, is a man making parade floats. His ideas are  . Expensive. And often discarded. Last week, Trump came out against his own plan to give huge tax cuts to the rich. He discarded his past opposition to raising the minimum wage. And he offhandedly suggested that the United States might pay back only a percentage of its debts, an idea that would rock the world economy and America’s place in it. “I don’t like either of them. But at least one of them is in the real world. And one has no bearing on reality,” Tanner said. “I simply believe Donald Trump is unqualified to be president. Hillary’s qualified. [And] I mean, I disagree with her on almost everything. ” To draw a full portrait of Clinton’s ideas, The Post reviewed her campaign platform and her speeches, TV interviews and performances in the Democratic debates. In that platform, there are sweeping goals inherited from President Obama: immigration reform. Gun control. And there are a few abrupt shifts to the left, made during the race against Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont. Previously, for instance, Clinton argued that the United States should continue deporting children who cross the U. S. border illegally, in order to “send a message” that would discourage future migrations. But in March, after pressure by Sanders, Clinton gave. “I will not deport children,” she said in a debate. Clinton has never adopted Sanders’s basic vision of liberalism  —   that the simplest way to help the needy is to help everyone at once. “I also believe in affordable college, but I don’t believe in free college,” Clinton said at a debate in February, attacking Sanders’s simple, huge plan to make tuition free at public colleges. “What I want to do is make sure   kids  —   not Donald Trump’s kids  —   get to be able to afford college. ” Clinton’s solution for college is cheaper: $350 billion over 10 years, versus $750 billion for Sanders. But it’s not simple. Clinton’s plan is to determine what families can afford to pay, without borrowing, and provide the rest of the money as a grant. But that requires   bureaucratic determinations to find the right number for every family. She also wants to help students by extending a tax credit that has a history going back to the tenure of her famously wonky husband. It can be worth up to $2, 500. But only if students find their Form   then fill out the relevant portions of Form 8863, then enter the amount from lines 8 and 19 of Form 8863 in lines 68 and 50 of their Form 1040. Just like that. “There’s some inevitable   here between cost and simplicity,” said Marc Goldwein of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. “Put me down for, ‘Let’s spend our scarce resources more carefully, even if it means more complexity.’ ” But that complexity sometimes backfires. In this case, watchdogs say more than a quarter of those who deserve education credits don’t bother applying. And the IRS paid more than $5. 6 billion to people who applied for educational credits but  —   upon later review  —   may not have deserved them. The pattern repeats. In health care, Sanders wants to rip up the system, start over and make the government everyone’s insurer. Clinton wants to help in part by adding a tax credit to give families up to $5, 000 to cover    payments. In Appalachia, Sanders promises to undo the trade deals that he blames for killing factory jobs. Clinton’s plans include extending a tax credit. The credit, which already exists, would be tapered to spur new investment in areas that declined with coal. But it comes with just a little red tape. The rules, for example, require a certified Community Development Entity to make a Qualified Low Income Community Investment in a Qualified Active Low Income Community Business. To get the money, a business must perform at least 50 percent of its business and have at least 40 percent of its tangible property within a designed Low Income Community. Also, by rule, the business can’t be a racetrack, massage parlor, tanning salon or what the government calls a “hot tub facility. ” Before the credit expired the last time, a Senate study found it was so loopholed that  —   in one instance  —   it had been used to pay for a dolphin exhibit at the Atlanta aquarium. “I do not believe, in totality, that’s enough,” said West Virginia State Rep. Clif Moore, a Democrat who represents the heart of coal country. “I don’t think she’s offering anything that’s in and of itself brand new. She doesn’t have the lightning rod. ” Clinton’s approach is an extension of the one that both her husband and President Obama used to make change in the face of a balky Congress and hostile states. Instead of handing out money, they handed out tax benefits. Democrats could celebrate the benefit, Republicans the cut. Instead of simple, universal benefit programs, they engineered complex solutions  —   like the Affordable Care Act  —   that were supposed to be customized to fit consumers’ needs. The result, now, is a government that groans under the weight of its complexity. The tax code has changed more than 4, 000 times since 2004. The overwhelmed IRS expects to answer just 47 percent of the calls made to its   staff this year, and it has 923, 000 unanswered letters. The broader growth of federal regulation has also caused a boom in the number of professional “compliance officers,” whose entire job is to follow rules: There are 136, 000 in the private sector, at last count. Clinton’s solutions would add complexity to complexity. That, in a way, requires its own kind of faith: that bureaucrats can make the kind of   decisions necessary to keep such a detailed enterprise running. Her campaign’s argument is that, in today’s Washington, that’s the only way to do it. Said Jake Sullivan, a Clinton policy adviser: Clinton “won’t make promises that she can’t keep or hide the details from the people whose vote she’s trying to earn. ” ",0,0,0,0,0,0,38
39,39,31330,31338,50103,Magic Bullet: Rush and Caller Reveal How ’Clinton Cash’ Uranium Revelation Turns Democrats into Trump Voters - Breitbart,Breitbart,Jerome Hudson,2016-10-21,2016.0,10.0,,"Conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh told his audience Friday that the information found in the WikiLeaks dumps of John Podesta’s emails confirms “everything” written in Breitbart News    Peter Schweizer’s book Clinton Cash: The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Businesses Helped Make Bill and Hillary. [“These WikiLeaks dumps are documenting practically everything that Schweizer wrote,” Limbaugh said. “Everything in Schweizer’s book  —   we didn’t need it documented, we knew it was true. ”  “That book nails the Clintons. ” The conservative talk radio legend was responding to a caller who said he educates potential voters by explaining to them how   of State Hillary Clinton helped broker the sale of 20% of U. S. uranium to the Russian government. Indeed, in 2010, Clinton approved the transfer of half of U. S. Uranium output to the Kremlin. As Clinton Cash documents in great detail, Hillary Clinton’s State Department was one of eight agencies to review the deal  —   but Hillary Clinton was the only agency head whose family foundation received $145 million in donations from people connected to the sale, as reported by the New York Times. In fact, Ian Telfer, the head of the Russian government’s uranium company, made a secret $2. 35 million foreign donation to the Clinton Foundation, a Times investigation confirmed: As the Russians gradually assumed control of Uranium One in three separate transactions from 2009 to 2013, Canadian records show, a flow of cash made its way to the Clinton Foundation. Uranium One’s chairman used his family foundation to make four donations totaling $2. 35 million   …     Other people with ties to the company made donations as well. Bill Clinton also received a $500, 000 speaking fee for a speech in Moscow paid for by a Russian   bank. “And, in one case, a Russian investment bank connected to the deals paid money to Bill Clinton personally, through a    speaker’s fee,” reports the New Yorker. “The   are not reporting it,” Limbaugh fumed. “They don’t have him on as a guest to explain it. They ignore it, or try to ridicule it. ” Before it was released last year, the New York Times bestselling investigative exposé Clinton Cash was being called the “most anticipated and feared book of a presidential cycle,” according to the New York Times.

","     Democrats are now facing a tougher road to capturing the Senate majority as the presidential race tightens and Donald Trump is not proving to be the dramatic drag on   candidates that Republicans once feared. Trump’s resilience and faltering Democratic campaigns in battleground states mean the fight for the Senate has settled into a    brawl likely to result in a chamber that will be closely divided or potentially even tied. Democrats can still manage to win the four or five seats they need to claim the Senate majority, but the battle has shifted from purple states that Barack Obama twice carried  —   Ohio and Florida  —   to Indiana, Missouri and North Carolina, where Obama lost in 2012.   [Republican senators create distance from Trump, but will it be enough?]   While Democrats are continuing their efforts in select states to tie incumbent Republican senators to Trump, Republicans are looking to flip that script in those redder states, yoking Democratic candidates to their own unpopular nominee. “Evan Bayh voted with Hillary Clinton up to 85 percent of the time,” a   intones in an ad now being aired in the Hoosier State by a major Republican super PAC. “Bayh voted with them; not with Indiana. ”    The significant shift in the Senate battlefield appears to be the result of voters separating Trump  —   once considered so toxic that House Speaker Paul D. Ryan ( .) waffled about whether to support him  —   from Republicans running on the same ballot with him. That recognition could lead to more voters splitting their ticket between Clinton and a Republican House or Senate candidate. “There is very much a feeling among voters that Donald Trump is sort of his own brand,” said Ian Prior, the communications director of the   Senate Leadership Fund super PAC, citing internal research. “People don’t view him as this traditional Republican where he says something and that means that everybody else in the House or Senate must agree with him. ” Trump is also holding his own at the top of the ticket, with a new Washington   poll showing him locked in a virtual tie with Clinton among likely voters, with Clinton leading 46 to 44 percent.   [New poll shows Clinton and Trump in a virtual dead heat]   With six weeks until Election Day, a new map has emerged as Democrats trying to buck recent history in winning back the majority in a presidential election year. Over the past 60 years, the majority has only changed hands once in those 15 presidential elections  —   in 1980, when Ronald Reagan’s landslide swept Republicans into the Senate majority. As recently as June, Democrats saw Ohio and Florida as key battlegrounds, booking a combined eight figures worth of television time there. Those states are no longer seen as prime pickup opportunities.   [In Senate spending shifts, Democrats show new doubts about Ohio, confidence in Colorado]   In Ohio, former governor Ted Strickland has been badly outraised and outspent by incumbent Sen. Rob Portman, and national Democratic groups have withdrawn ad reservations as he has lagged in the polls. In Florida, Rep. Patrick Murphy is in striking distance of incumbent Sen. Marco Rubio, but the Democrat had been forced to fend off questions about his resume in a big state where television time is pricey. Democrats’ hopes of expanding the Senate map into solidly Republican states such as Arizona, Georgia and Arkansas have not panned out. But they appear to be on track to pick up   seats in Illinois and Wisconsin, and they are in very competitive races in Pennsylvania and New Hampshire, as well as Nevada, where they are hoping to keep control of the seat of retiring Sen. Harry M. Reid (D). Democrats need to flip five seats to win an outright majority  —   four if Clinton wins, allowing her running mate, Tim Kaine (Va.) to cast tiebreaking votes. Sen. Jon Tester (Mont.) chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, played down the need for Democratic candidates to break with Clinton. “What they need to show is what they’re going to do when they get back here and show the fact that the Republicans really haven’t done anything,” Tester said in a Capitol Hill interview. “If they tailor that to each one of their states, they can be effective. And they have been, by the way. ” That makes the trio of Indiana, Missouri and North Carolina suddenly crucial. And while Democratic candidate are locked in tight races there, according to recent polls, Republicans have started shifting resources into those states, and they believe they have a potent message to push. The Senate Leadership Fund, which ran the Indiana spot and has booked nearly $60 million worth of ads around the country, recently debuted ads targeting Jason Kander, the Missouri secretary of state running to unseat Sen. Roy Blunt ( .) as a “career politician” who is “too liberal for Missouri. ”   [GOP Sen. Roy Blunt faces tough   reality: No seat is safe]   Back in March, after Kander appeared at an event with Clinton ahead of the state’s Democratic primary, Blunt issued a web video of his remarks touting Clinton as the “most prepared” person since George Washington to run for president.    More recently, Blunt’s campaign went on air with an ad asking this question: “Do you believe we’re headed in the right direction? Hillary Clinton and Jason Kander do. ” Prior of the Senate Leadership Fund said Democratic candidates are “attached at the hip” to Clinton due not only to their refusal to break with her, but also the Clinton family’s long history in the party. Some Democrats are privately concerned that voters in a few states, a small sliver but potentially decisive, are making a conscious decision to support Clinton but vote against the Democratic Senate candidate as a way to put a check on her power in office. That would echo the argument that some Republicans Senate candidates like John McCain (Ariz.) are making not to give Clinton a “blank check” as president. In New Hampshire, for example, Gov. Maggie Hassan (D) is dramatically more popular than Clinton in that state, but she is struggling in her race against Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R). A late August poll by the University of New Hampshire found Hassan maintaining her popularity, with 52 percent of voters having a favorable impression of her while just 37 percent held an unfavorable view, while Ayotte was viewed favorably by 46 percent and unfavorably by 42 percent of voters. Yet that poll showed the race in a statistical tie, 44 percent for Hassan to 42 percent for Ayotte, and two other recent polls have given Ayotte the lead. Most New Hampshire polls give Clinton a lead over Trump, despite her own brutal favorable ratings. An early September poll there by Emerson College found that 60 percent of New Hampshire voters have an unfavorable impression. In Indiana, Bayh is drawing on decades of goodwill earned during the three Senate terms served by his father, Birch Bayh, as well as his own tenure as governor and senator. But his GOP opponent, Rep. Todd C. Young, is getting major help from outside groups in his bid to convince voters that Bayh has lost touch with the state. In North Carolina, former state lawmaker Deborah Ross has taken advantage of a lackluster campaign from incumbent Sen. Richard Burr (R) as   ad money is starting to flow in the Tar Heel State. And in Missouri, Kander has waged an energetic bid that has played up his own military background as well as Blunt’s long tenure in Washington. A striking new ad shows Kander assembling an assault rifle blindfolded, while he discusses his Army service and his support for gun buyer background checks. Kander has tried to run as an independent Democrat, distancing himself from Obama and Clinton  —   criticizing the Iran nuclear deal, for instance, and recent Obama administration environmental regulations. He recently brought Vice President Biden in to campaign for him and in an interview afterward said he has “no plans” to bring Obama to his state. “Not everybody who goes to Washington becomes Washington,” Kander said in an interview last month, explaining why Biden would be welcomed there. Sen. Roger Wicker (Miss.) chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, said he was “not surprised about anything”  —   including Kander’s competitive race against Blunt. “We’ve always viewed Jason Kander as very glib and very photogenic, and we knew he hired a great ad agency,” Wicker said. But Blunt and his fellow incumbents “are just very talented legislators,” Wicker added. “They’re in step with their states, and they’ve been working hard. That’s how you win an election in a competitive state. ” Paul Kane contributed to this report.",0,0,0,0,0,0,41

Please follow the steps below, A meeting in Mexico City on Wednesday will bring together two of the most unpopular men in Mexico. On the one hand, there’s Donald Trump, widely reviled and frequently bashed in   effigy over his derogatory comments about the country and its citizens —  from the suggestion, in his campaign launch, that Mexican immigrants to the United States are by and large criminals and rapists, to his declaration that Mexico is an “enemy” of the United States. On the other, there’s Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto, a telegenic and glamorous politician who has nonetheless been plagued by scandals and tainted by alleged ties to organized crime, a plagiarism scandal, and deep unfavorable ratings among women. Perhaps the two men will have some things to talk about when they convene at Los Pinos, the Mexican executive residence. Trump’s Visit to Mexico  Peña Nieto, who is commonly known as EPN, faces troubles that run deep. In a poll conducted by the newspaper El Universal in July, 63 percent of respondents disapproved of his performance. (For comparison, Trump is at 75 percent unfavorability.) That’s the result of a slow but steady erosion since shortly after he took office in 2012, when 56 percent approved and 29 percent disapproved. A full   said Mexico was on the wrong track.   said they felt Peña Nieto was not in control of the country’s problems. Almost six in 10 said the country was worse off during his presidency. EPN’s biggest problems are straightforward: Voters say Mexico’s economy is too weak (though the peso tends to wax with Trump’s troubles and wane when he does well). They are upset about widespread government corruption across the country —  though that’s not exclusively a problem restricted to Peña Nieto’s  Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). And they’re angry about how EPN has fought drug trafficking. Mexicans feel that he has not done enough to combat the narcotics trade, and the escape of Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán, the highly wanted cartel boss, from prison in July 2015 was widely viewed as evidence of government incompetence at best —  or of collusion and complicity at worse. Peña Nieto must have been extremely relieved to be able to break the news on Twitter, in January, that El Chapo had been recaptured. Peña Nieto, who turned 50 last month, has been president since 2012, when he won a bitterly contested election. He was the candidate of the centrist PRI, which held power in Mexico from 1929 until 2000. But at the turn of the millennium, Mexican voters finally turned the PRI out, installing Vicente Fox, who hailed from a more conservative party called the National Action Party. EPN represented the PRI’s return to power after 12 years. Before running for president, Peña Nieto was governor of the state of Mexico, which surrounds Mexico City to the west, north, and east. In the 2012 election, his primary opponent was Andrés Manuel López Obrador, a leftist. Allegations of fraud and   tainted the election and led to widespread protests in the weeks immediately following the July 2012 balloting. EPN’s presidency has seen several rocky stretches. He pushed a series of constitutional reforms and market openings, which have been met with mixed response the Universal poll showed his reforms rated among both the most and least popular things he’d done. Despite promising to reduce violence connected to the drug trade, there have been several spikes in crime —  including in the capital. The most notable is the disappearance of 43 students in the state of Guerrero, in which local officials are widely suspected of conspiring with drug cartels. Peña Nieto has also introduced measures to stop corruption, but his efforts and credibility in that direction have been hurt by his own proximity to scandal. In the summer of 2015, it emerged that EPN’s wife and finance minister both bought houses with financing help from a contractor who received hundreds of millions in government contracts. The president himself had lived   in another home belonging to the contractor during his election campaign. A government investigation cleared EPN and his wife, though there are now new allegations that he took   favors from a government contractor. Just last week, investigative journalist Carmen Aristegui reported that EPN plagiarized nearly a third of his undergraduate thesis. The good news for EPN, if not for the PRI, is that he does not face  : Presidents in Mexico are constitutionally limited to a single   term. Nonetheless, he’s taking some political risks by welcoming Trump to Mexico City on Wednesday. Peña Nieto has not minced words about Trump in the past, and like Trump, he has courted controversy. In fact, the president seems to have found the American candidate a useful   for improving his own standing. He has, unsurprisingly, said that Mexico will not pay for a wall along its border with the United States, even as Trump insists it will. (Trump likes to say that every time a Mexican official says this, he adds 10 feet to the well’s height.) Peña Nieto also accused Trump of  “xenophobic speech that reminds us (of the speech) of Hitler and Mussolini. ” More recently, EPN has seemed to   his remarks about Trump, though he has made the comparison to Hitler and Mussolini repeatedly over the last year. The political calculus for Trump in visiting Mexico is tough to figure out, as Dan Drezner and Philip Bump both explain. For Peña Nieto there is perhaps a more obvious payoff, though also some substantial risks. By inviting Trump to Mexico, EPN could distract from his own troubles, and he might appear statesmanlike —  having lured the great ogre Trump to visit Mexico and reckon with the country    in a meeting where Peña Nieto will presumably once again solidly reject any prospect of Mexico paying for the wall. After news of the meeting broke last night, he tweeted, “I believe in dialogue to promote Mexico’s interests in the world and, principally, to protect Mexicans, wherever they might be. ” On the other hand, politicians much more   with Trump than EPN have found themselves flummoxed by the Republican nominee. Who knows what Trump might do or say in the meeting, or report about it afterward? New York Times reporter Elizabeth Malkin reports that Mexicans were immediately outraged by the invitation, and she wondered how the Mexican president planned to counteract Trump’s spin. Her colleague Kirk Semple speculated that there could be large protests in Mexico City, and NBC and The Washington Post both reported that the U. S. Embassy had warned Trump’s campaign against making such a trip on short notice. “This is appeasement of the worst kind. Peña Nieto is like [Neville] Chamberlain to his Hitler,” Alejandro Hope, a former Mexican intelligence official, told The Wall Street Journal. Fox, the former president, who has jousted in the media with Trump over the wall and other issues, blasted his successor. “He will even be considered like a traitor because we don’t accept to be offended. I think this is a big mistake on the part of President Peña,” Fox said. Trump has said repeatedly that Mexican leaders are outsmarting American ones, and on Wednesday, Trump and Peña Nieto will engage in a battle of wits to see who fares better. The visit confirms an essential truth about politicians: Unpopular leaders will try all sorts of risky maneuvers to improve their standing.

46,46,34379,35000,53820,Trump Army secretary pick gave a lecture arguing against the theory of evolution ,CNN,,2017-05-01,2017.0,5.0,," (CNN) President Donald Trump’s pick to be secretary of the Army, former army doctor Mark Green, is a   ”creationist” who delivered a lecture arguing against the theory of evolution.  Green’s views and past statements are facing scrutiny ahead of his confirmation hearing, which has yet to be scheduled. If confirmed, Green wouldn’t be the only prominent doctor and member of the Trump administration to reject evolution. HUD Secretary Ben Carson has also made similar arguments and once said the theory of evolution was encouraged by Satan. Green, a Tennessee state senator, has faced opposition from Democrats and LGBT groups over his past   comments. In one comment, from September, Green said, ”If you poll the psychiatrists, they’re going to tell you that transgender is a disease.” The National Academy of Sciences says that the theory of evolution ”is supported by so many observations and confirming experiments that scientists are confident that the basic components of the theory will not be overturned by new evidence.” The group adds, ”Because the evidence supporting it is so strong, scientists no longer question whether biological evolution has occurred and is continuing to occur. Instead, they investigate the mechanisms of evolution, how rapidly evolution can take place, and related questions.” Green rejects the conclusions of scientists in his lecture. In his 2015 speech to a church to Cincinnati titled ’Isn’t Evolution A Solution? Green dedicated nearly an hour to explaining why his work as a medical doctor taught him to reject the theory. Green claims that the theory of evolution violates physical law, using the example of a lawn mower left out in a backyard. ”The evolutionists have their bad argument, too,” Green said. They say, ’Well, I can’t explain how it went from this to incredibly complex, so it must have been billions of years.’ That’s kind of where they put their faith. The truth of the matter is is the second law of thermo fluid dynamics says that the world progresses from order to disorder not disorder to order. ”If you put a lawn mower out in your yard and a hundred years come back, it’s rusted and falling apart. You can’t put parts out there and a hundred years later it’s gonna come back together. That is a violation of a law of thermodynamics. A physical law that exists in the universe.” Green also argues that processes allowing human life, such as   are ’irreducibly complex’ and says that is evidence of a creator. ”Irreducible complexity is important in the argument for the creationist because of this: Evolution assumes a series of minuscule changes over time, and each change has to give a survival advantage to the organism. If it doesn’t, and it causes a disadvantage the organism dies and evolution ends,” Green said.  Later in the speech, Green adds, ”The question is, did all of this happen by chance operating inside the laws of chemistry and physics? Or is this unbelievable engineering, and is the scientific mind going to look at it and make the conclusion, observation, and conclusion that it was created and not that it evolved. Again, remember time is not the hero of the plot. Time is the villain, because over time things break down, they don’t assemble themselves together.” Green did not respond to a request for comment. A White House spokesperson told CNN’s KFile that a spokesperson handling Green’s nomination would contact them, but Green’s spokesperson did not. In a statement announcing his nomination in early April, Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis put his full support behind Green. ”He had my full support during the selection process, and he will have my full support during the Senate confirmation process. I am confident of Mark’s ability to effectively lead the Army,” Mattis said. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,46

","         Donald Trump said that when he became president, it would be easier to sue media companies “and win lots of money. ” As if on cue, first lady Melania Trump recovered a reported $2. 9 million in a libel suit Wednesday, Day 82 of her husband’s presidency. The victory came with a huge asterisk, however: The settlement was approved by a court in England, where libel protections for journalists are far weaker than in the United States. The lawsuit centered on an article published last summer by the Daily Mail tabloid, part of which addressed an unsubstantiated report in a Slovenian magazine that Melania Trump had doubled as a sex worker early in her modeling career. Unlike several obscure blogs that treated the salacious allegation as truth, the Daily Mail conducted its own investigation and reported that “there is no evidence to back up these startling claims. ” The newspaper included a forceful denial by the man who ran the modeling agency for which Trump worked. Nevertheless, Trump sued the Daily Mail in London and in the United States, since the article could be read online. A court in Maryland threw out the case on jurisdictional grounds, so Trump refiled in New York in February.      Donald Trump and his wife, Melania Trump, celebrate at a New Year’s Eve party three weeks before Inauguration Day. (Evan   Press)  It is almost impossible to imagine that Trump would have succeeded in a U. S. court. The Daily Mail did not report that she was a sex worker  —   again, it said “there is no evidence” that she was  —   but even if the tabloid had printed such a claim, Trump would have had to prove not only that the claim was false but also that it was published with “actual malice. ” According to the Legal Information Institute at Cornell University Law School, “Actual malice means that a statement was made with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether or not it was false. ” In the U. S. legal system, the “actual malice” standard protects journalists from losing libel suits simply because of honest mistakes. But there is no such protection in England, as I wrote last fall, when Donald Trump said he wanted U. S. libel standards to mirror England’s: News outlets must “prove that the words complained of were true or substantially true. ” There is no allowance for innocent mistakes, and it is possible for media companies to lose cases based on statements that are logical but cannot be proven in court. Until recently, English law was so tough on the media that disgruntled subjects of news reports could use the country’s court system to carry out what the New York legislature called “libel terrorism. ” That provocative phrase appeared in the title of a bill passed in New York in 2008 that created the model for the federal Speech Act of 2010. “Libel terrorism” refers to the act of suppressing press freedom by bringing lawsuits against American journalists in foreign countries, such as Britain. Appearing before London’s High Court, John Kelly, an attorney for Melania Trump, made the following argument: “The suggestion that [ ] allegations even merit investigation is deeply offensive and has caused a great deal of upset and distress to the claimant. ” That would never fly in the United States. The idea that a news outlet could lose a libel case for merely investigating a claim  —   and ultimately deeming it baseless  —   is completely antithetical to First Amendment principles. We don’t know for sure whether this would have been a winning argument in London, since the Daily Mail agreed to settle before the point of a court ruling. But the fact that the tabloid was willing to pay damages suggests that it sensed trouble. The Trumps can enjoy this legal victory and their additional millions, but the case does not have much, if any, bearing on the president’s perpetual feud with the U. S. media. He would have to dramatically alter U. S. libel standards to achieve similar results in his own country, and he does not seem serious about doing so.",0,0,0,0,0,0,48

","President Trump abruptly fired embattled   late Tuesday afternoon for mishandling the feds’ probe into Hillary Clinton’s private email server, a top Justice Department official said. “The FBI’s reputation and credibility have suffered substantial damage, and it has affected the entire Department of Justice,’’ Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein wrote in a memo explaining Comey’s dismissal. “I cannot defend the director’s handling of the conclusion of the investigation of Secretary Clinton’s emails, and I do not understand his refusal to accept the nearly universal judgment that he was mistaken. Almost everyone agrees that the director made serious mistakes; it is one of the few issues that unites people of diverse perspectives. ’’ Trump also issued a statement, saying the FBI needed fresh leadership. “The FBI is one of our nation’s most cherished and respected institutions and today will mark a new beginning for our crown jewel of law enforcement,” Trump said in a statement. Trump acted based on the recommendations of both Rosenstein and Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who also slammed Comey in a memo released by the White House. “I have concluded that a fresh start is needed at the leadership of the FBI,’’ Sessions wrote. “I must recommend that you remove Director James B. Comey, Jr. and identify an experienced and qualified individual to lead the great men and women of the FBI. ’’ The president also sent a letter breaking the news to Comey, who headed the agency as it was investigating possible ties between the Trump campaign and administration to Russia, a probe that remains ongoing. “I received the attached letters from the attorney general and deputy attorney general recommending your dismissal as the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. I have accepted their recommendation and you are hereby terminated and removed from office effective immediately,” Trump wrote. He then expressed his appreciation to Comey for telling him he was not the target of an FBI investigation. “While I greatly appreciate you informing me, on three separate occasions, that I am not under investigation, I nevertheless concur with the Department of Justice that you are not able to effectively lead the bureau,” Trump wrote. “It is essential that we find new leadership for the FBI that restores public trust and confidence in its vital law enforcement mission,” Trump added before wishing the Yonkers native “the best of luck in your future endeavors. ” Sen. Lindsey Graham ( ) chairman of the Senate Subcommittees on Crime & Terrorism, called it a difficult decision but backed the move. “I appreciate Director Comey’s service to our nation in a variety of roles,” Graham said. “Given the recent controversies surrounding the director, I believe a fresh start will serve the FBI and the nation well. I encourage the President to select the most qualified professional available who will serve our nation’s interests. ” The White House said the search for a new FBI director will begin immediately. The White House made the stunning announcement shortly after the FBI corrected a sentence in Comey’s sworn testimony on Capitol Hill last week. Comey told lawmakers that   including some with classified information. On Tuesday, the FBI said in a   letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee that only “a small number” of the thousands of emails found on the laptop had been forwarded there while most had simply been backed up from electronic devices. Most of the email chains on the laptop containing classified information were not the result of forwarding, the FBI said. Comey had come under intense criticism from both Republicans and Democrats for his handling of Clinton’s email probe. Clinton supporters said he cost her the election with his   announcement that he was reopening the probe into the emails after they were found on Weiner’s computer. Republicans accused him of going soft on Clinton, when they wanted prosecuted for sending classified material on her private server. Comey, 56, was nominated by President Obama for the FBI post in 2013 to a   term. Praised for his independence and integrity, Comey has spent three decades in law enforcement and has been no stranger to controversy. Spokesman Sean Spicer had hedged just hours earlier that he was unaware of any signs that Trump had lost confidence in Comey. “I have no reason to believe  —   I haven’t asked him. So I don’t  —   I have not asked the president since the last time we spoke about this,” he said. “I don’t want to start speaking on behalf of the President without speaking to him first. ”",0,0,0,0,0,0,50

Flynn,2016-12-14,2016.0,12.0,,"Yasmin Seweid disappeared. Then her story did. [The Baruch College freshman’s tale of subway harassment by a trio of inebriated Donald   assailants unraveled on Wednesday after New York City police failed to find a single witness or any security footage corroborating the teen’s colorful account.  “Trump America is real and I witnessed it first hand last night!” Seweid wrote on Facebook on December 2. “What a traumatizing night. ” The trauma allegedly included the intoxicated triumvirate ripping a strap from a handbag and attempting to pull the hijab from her head. All the while, they chanted “Trump! Trump!” and issued such insulting comments as, “Look, it’s a f —  ing terrorist” and “Get the hell out of the country!” “It breaks my heart that so many individuals chose to be bystanders while watching me get harassed verbally and physically by these disgusting pigs,” Seweid declared on her Facebook page, which, like her, ultimately became inaccessible in the aftermath of the story. The truth, too, proved elusive, as Seweid clung to her story for nearly two weeks before confessing to the hoax on Wednesday. The cops charged her with two misdemeanors, obstructing governmental administration and filing a false report, that each potentially carries a year behind bars upon conviction. The fact that the political demographics in Manhattan don’t exactly match Montana’s made the entire saga difficult to digest. In the big borough on the tiny island where the faux incident supposedly took place, Clinton   supporters outnumbered Trump voters 515, 481 to 58, 935. But Make America Great Again enthusiasts apparently peopled this particular subway car, with onlookers refusing to intervene and three Trump supporters feeling comfortable in Clinton Country to terrorize a beautiful young woman in public. With such inconvenient truths clashing with an    narrative, true believers believed. “The incident is another in a growing list of bias crimes across the city since Trump’s election,” the New York Daily News reported. “Yasmin’s experience seems to be one of the growing number of racially motivated attacks that have occurred in the wake of Donald Trump’s surprise electoral victory,” Rafi Schwartz wrote at Fusion. Buzzfeed, which apparently neglects to add an “alleged” when the accused support the   elected to headline its story on the matter: “Drunk Men Yelling ‘Donald Trump’ Attempt To Remove Woman’s Hijab On NYC Subway. ” The story now gets scrubbed away like its author’s Facebook page. But the narrative remains. On MSNBC Wednesday night, Joy Reid asked of hate crimes against Muslim Americans, “How do we know those crimes will be continued to be prosecuted?” Filling in for Rachel Maddow, Reid played footage of the regular host’s interview with Attorney General Loretta Lynch. “In terms of   hate crimes, [it’s] the biggest upsurge since ” Maddow claimed, which provoked a lengthy response from Lorretta Lynch on how Muslims constitute “our neighbors and friends and family members. ” They certainly do for Yasmin Seweid, whose father noted her late arrival home on December 1. Kids say the darndest things to escape the wrath of a strict Muslim parent —  especially when their clandestine date with a Christian runs past curfew. It was no hate crime. It was a crime of passion.",0,0,0,0,0,0,51

Has the way you identify yourself as a person of color  —   or as a white person  —   changed over the last eight years? Have your personal politics around race shifted  ? Some people said yes, but weren’t lining up to credit Obama: Many others seemed to think that Obama’s presidency has changed the country’s landscape in some important ways, even if the changes didn’t come from any specific action: The Obama Effects that you all identified spanned a range of topics, but we noticed a few categories in particular that seemed to have gotten a lot of attention. Some of you noted that Obama’s presidency opened up opportunities for people to talk about race, period: A lot of people went further, saying that Obama hadn’t just created space for these discussions, his personal identity allowed for a sense of nuance that previous conversations had been lacking: Groups that had felt invisible suddenly weren’t so invisible anymore: This seemed particularly salient for multiracial folks. Some saw Obama’s mixed racial identity as a chance to more fully embrace their own: Others experienced the opposite: We talked about how the Obama family’s tenure in the White House relates to feminism, respectability and visibility: And we speculated about what all this means for the future: It’s clear that there’s a lot to sort through, and this is just the beginning.

","Those who were terrorized by the bomb threats against Jewish community centers around North America breathed a sigh of relief when the alleged perpetrator was arrested on Thursday. The fact that the person behind the more than 100 threats turned out to be an Israeli Jew was the sort of thing that left many Jews feeling a bit ashamed that a   could have carried out this vile deed even if, as has been reported, he may have a brain disorder and be mentally disturbed. But the reaction from some of the liberal groups that had used these incidents to blame President Donald Trump for what they claimed was a surge of   had to involve more than a few blushes. The arrest of the person who had been tracked down by the joint efforts of the FBI and Israeli police provided an astonishing end to a crime story that had generated widespread outrage. This is not the first time a hate crime against an ethnic or religious minority turned out to have been committed by a member of the targeted group. Nor should it blind the world to the reality of   since, as FBI   statistics have consistently shown, such offenses far outnumber those committed against members of any other faith, including Muslims, the group that has supposedly been under siege from a mythical    backlash.   groups do spout hate against Jews and, in an even more prevalent and dangerous trend, the far Left and Islamist groups have joined forces in promoting   hate that masquerades as  . The narrative of Trump’s unleashing the beast of   incitement had a certain superficial logic to it, since his behavior while running for president was, at best, insensitive, and, at worst, he seemed at times to be dog whistling to extremists. But it was a bit too convenient to be true. The arrest of the Israeli teenager, along with the arrest of a   writer in another   case, makes the effort to connect the dots between the bomb threats and Trump a fiasco. Had the mastermind behind the more than 100 threats been a white supremacist or someone who could have been labeled an   sympathizer or even an extremist Republican, it would have vindicated the effort to blame the president. Instead, Democratic politicians and liberal groups who pushed this narrative ought to apologize, if not to the president, then to their deceived constituents who eagerly applauded an    version of events that linked a political opponent to hate. That won’t happen, because the same liberals who were so heavily invested in blaming Trump are already falling back to the position that even if the president didn’t inspire those who committed these crimes, his conduct was still reprehensible and might have incited somebody to do something bad somewhere. But after months of hyping a few egregious incidents into a   panic about   it will take more than such a lame rationalization to wipe the egg off of their faces. Liberal Jewish groups and their supporters were devastated by Trump’s victory and were naturally drawn to efforts to “resist” his presidency. And the bomb threats provided them with a coherent narrative they could use to justify stepping over the line into open partisan warfare against the new administration. The tipoff that there was something wrong with this narrative was the way   who were themselves responsible for promoting   attacks on Israel and its supporters jumped at the opportunity to blame Trump for Jew hatred. Among them was Linda Sarsour, a   who was one of the chief organizers of the women’s march against Trump on inauguration weekend and then of the “women’s strike” in March. She is also a supporter of the BDS (Boycott, Divest, Sanctions) movement that trades in   invective and delegitimization. She was nonetheless embraced as a heroine by many Jewish liberals. The desire to build a bigger   coalition was so great that not even her comment to Vanity Fair that Jewish women would not be accepted in the protest movement unless they disavowed Zionism wasn’t enough to deter some on the left from associating with her.   exists in the fever swamps of the far Right, but the chief proponents of   invective in the public square today are those on the left who disguise their   behind a thin veneer of  . It is this strange alliance of Islamist and liberal elites that is the driving force of the trend that the Obama State Department correctly labeled a “rising tide of  . ” But in their eagerness to associate Trump with Jew hatred, liberals hitched their wagon to a false narrative in which a political opponent could be tarred with the brush of hate. By “crying wolf” about Trump, liberal groups not only undermined their own credibility, they also diverted attention from genuine problems like the BDS movement and made it harder to focus on combating their hate. For all of his obvious flaws, Trump is clearly well disposed to both Jews and Israel. Yet Jewish liberals were too invested in their opposition to him to understand that by linking him to   they were making a colossal strategic error. Making   a political football, instead of a cause that unites both parties and their leaders, was a dangerous game that has now blown up in their faces. Correcting that mistake should start with an apology, but it must also involve a realization among liberals that the “everybody I don’t like is Hitler” paradigm not only does nothing to combat   but will also make it more difficult to mobilize public opinion the next time a genuine threat arises.,",0,0,0,0,0,0,53

"," Surveying the wreckage of the Middle East and the fraying of Europe, President Obama understandably would like us to believe that no other policy could have worked better.  The United States has tried them all, his administration argues: massive invasion, in Iraq; surgical intervention, in Libya; studied aloofness, in Syria. Three approaches, same result: chaos and destruction.  Fred Hiatt is the editorial page editor of The Post. He writes editorials for the newspaper and a biweekly column that appears on Mondays. He also contributes to the PostPartisan blog. View Archive   Facebook Google+ RSS   So why bother? Why get sucked into “a transformation that will play out for a generation,” as Obama described it in his State of the Union address this year, “rooted in conflicts that date back millennia”?  Even setting aside the offensiveness of such a sweeping dismissal of Arab potential, the formulation is wrong on two counts, one prescriptive and one analytical. It offers no plausible path for Obama’s successor  —   who, as Obama’s own fitful, reluctant   shows, will not be able to ignore the region. Instead, it invites the kind of demagogic promises we have heard during the campaign, to “carpet bomb” Islamic militants until we find out whether “sand can glow in the dark,” as Sen. Ted Cruz ( .) threatened, or, in Donald Trump’s words, to “quickly, quickly” “knock the hell out of” the Islamic State and then “come back here and rebuild our country. ” More fundamentally, the administration’s fatalism ignores a fourth policy option that Obama, from the beginning, was determined not to try: patient,   engagement using all U. S. tools  —   diplomatic as well as military  —   with a positive outcome, not a fixed deadline, as the goal. That is an approach that has worked before. In Korea, the United States forged an intimate alliance more than a   ago, and today U. S. soldiers and diplomats are still present. U. S. support deterred an external foe while  —   and people forget this, given South Korea’s stability today  —   helping steady a society torn by civil war as its people gradually built a democracy. Obama came into office determined to avoid this approach. In Afghanistan, he set a timetable for troop withdrawal, untethered to conditions. In Libya, he bombed the Gaddafi regime out of power but did not stay to help a new government get on its feet. In Iraq, he overrode his civilian and military advisers and declined to keep in the country the 15, 000 or 20, 000  troops that might have helped preserve the stability the U. S. surge had helped achieve.  The president did not defend that withdrawal because   hatreds made Iraq a hopeless case. Just the reverse, in fact: Success had made a U. S. presence unnecessary. “This is a historic moment. A war is ending. A new day is upon us,” he said in 2011. “People throughout the region will see a new Iraq that’s determining its own destiny  —   a country in which people from different religious sects and ethnicities can resolve their differences peacefully through the democratic process. ” It does not require hindsight to appreciate the recklessness of his decision. True, few foretold just how completely the nation would fall apart, with a vicious caliphate occupying much of the country and a return of frequent bombings in Baghdad. But The Post’s editorial page was not alone in warning at the time that “a complete withdrawal sharply increases the risk that painfully won security gains in Iraq will come undone. ” I understand why Obama and so many other Americans reject persistent engagement, often derisively called “ . ” It is difficult, and the United States often does it badly and sometimes doesn’t succeed; Americans can’t impose democracy; we often end up doing work that we wish the locals or their neighbors would do. Obama is right, too, that other regions, such as the Pacific, are more important to the global economy and more central to U. S. strategy. But against all that wisdom stands one stubborn fact, again proved by Obama’s  : The United States does not have a choice. The unraveling doesn’t stay put, but spreads to Syria and Paris and Brussels and the skies over the Mediterranean and, eventually, the United States. Under conditions far more difficult than they might have been, the president finds himself unleashing bombers over Syria and dispatching soldiers into Iraq. He cannot acknowledge, maybe even to himself, that disengagement was a mistake. That is why, even as Americans are, once again, being killed in Iraq, Obama insists that no service members are in combat. But it would be healthy for the country, and the next president, to move beyond  . There is no “quickly, quickly” defeating Islamist terrorism  —   and there is no safe way to retreat from the challenge of combating it for the long term.

","  ISLAMABAD, Pakistan  ” The morning papers were giddy with hyperbole on Thursday over the news that Donald Trump had spoken to Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif by phone a day earlier and showered compliments on a country he once accused of  betrayal and disrespect ?  ” even offering to help the nuclear power solve its problems abroad.   ‰ Call me any time,  Trump tells PM, ? touted the Express Tribune, describing the  instant rapport ? between the two leaders during the congratulatory call initiated by Sharif. His office then released a readout of the call. The newspaper also suggested that the U. S.   who called Pakistan a  fantastic country ? with  fantastic people, ? might  prove to be Islamabad s good friend. ?  By the end of the day, though, the official tone had become more circumspect and commentators were skeptical that Trump, who has little   experience and has close business relations with Pakistan s archrival, India, really was ready to weigh in on the thorny issues that have long roiled the Muslim nation s international relations.  Our relationship with the United States is not about personalities  ” it is about institutions, ? said Nafees Zakaria, a spokesman for the Pakistani Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Describing Sharif s gesture as a  courtesy call, ? Zakaria said Pakistan would welcome any effort by Trump to ease regional tensions, but the spokesman added,  We do not comment on bilateral relations between sovereign countries. ? Khurshid Mahmud Kasuri, an analyst and former foreign minister, observed that although  Mr. Trump is a warmhearted person, ? he  lacks expertise in foreign policy ? and is not yet in office. Noting the obvious  excitement ? shown by Sharif s office over the conversation, Kasuri said,  One nice call . ‰. ‰. is not something we read too much into. ? Trump, he added archly,  could have been equally effusive with Indian Prime Minister [Narendra] Modi. ?  The reaction in India, not surprisingly, was cooler still. India and Pakistan have been at loggerheads over the Himalayan region of Kashmir for decades, but India has always opposed Pakistan s desire to have the United States or other countries play a mediation role. Tensions have escalated in recent months, with deadly border attacks against Indian forces and harsh repression of protesters in the   portion of Kashmir.  Insofar as the fantastic conversation is concerned . ‰. ‰. I would reserve my judgment, ? said Vikas Swarup, a spokesman for India s Ministry of External Affairs.  We have seen only a   version of that conversation. ?

Many comments posted on social media in India were derisive and mocking, as were many comments from Pakistanis.

While Donald Trump has declared himself wholeheartedly behind the blockade on Qatar, the state and defense departments have been sharply critical of the move, in private and in public.  The defence secretary, James Mattis, rushed to assure Doha of continuing support, mindful that US air operations in Syria, Iraq, Yemen and Afghanistan fly out of the   base, just outside the Qatari capital. Six days after Trump joined Riyadh in denouncing Qatar as a “funder of terrorism at a very high level” Mattis signed a $12bn arms deal with the Qataris. The state department issued a stinging rebuke of the behaviour of the Saudis and their Egyptian, Emirati and Bahraini allies, with the secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, warning them to make their demands on Qatar “reasonable and actionable”. Now that the list of 13 demands has been presented and Qatar has been given 10 days to comply, much will depend on what is seen as being reasonable and actionable. On Thursday, state spokeswoman Heather Nauert would not be drawn on the question. “I think that they [the Gulf protagonists] will know exactly what things are reasonable and what things are actionable,” she said. In reality, both sides in the dispute are accustomed to looking to the US for guidance. However, guidance from Washington has seldom been less clear.  Different parts of the US executive have often had very different approaches to foreign policy problems. During the Obama administration, for example, the White House was far more   and   than the Pentagon and the state department over Syria. But rarely, if ever, have the disagreements been so open, and the signalling so chaotic. The result has been to increase the risk of miscalculation in an already dangerous row.  The immediate crisis can be traced back directly to Trump’s first trip abroad as president, to Riyadh on 20 May, when he was feted and showered with flattery. Trump vaunted Saudi leadership and decisively sided with the Sunni Gulf states against Iran. Less publicly, Trump appears tacitly or explicitly to have given the green light to the Saudi royals to go on the offensive against its truculent neighbour. When the Qatar blockade was declared, Trump cheered it on in tweets, triggering alarm and countervailing moves from the Pentagon and state department. “The general ambience in the White House is that they are in line with Saudi, the UAE and the others,” a source in the Trump camp familiar with foreign and security policy said. “They don’t want to be leading this  —   this is an Arab Gulf matter  —   but they are backing it.  “Then came the signing of that deal with Qatar with DoD [Department of Defense]. That was the first sign that things were different from what we thought. “The difference seems to be very wide between the position of the White House and the statement made out of Foggy Bottom. It makes it look like there is a foreign policy, but there is an opposition to that foreign policy. That is really peculiar. It’s unexpected. ” The dissonance on policy toward Russia and Ukraine is equally striking, and was illustrated by the visit to Washington this week by the Ukrainian president, Petro Poroshenko. He had been led to believe that he would have a White House meeting with Trump, which would solidify his standing in the continuing conflict with eastern Ukraine separatists and their Moscow backers.  By the time Poroshenko left Kiev, the meeting had still not been confirmed. The White House was insisting that Poroshenko would only be meeting   Mike Pence, which would be a significant snub. It was only after persistent pressure from the national security adviser, HR McMaster, that a compromise was found. Pence and Poroshenko would “drop in” briefly on Trump and McMaster.  Even then, the president, who is reported to be personally under investigation over ties to Moscow, did not offer words of support or criticism of Russia’s aggression, describing Ukraine noncommittally as “a place that we’ve all been very much involved in. And you’ve been seeing it, and everybody’s been reading about it”.  It was only when Poroshenko arrived at the Pentagon that he received a clear gesture of US support, delivered by Mattis, who told him: “We support you in the face of threats to sovereignty, to international law or to the international order. ” Ivo Daalder, former US ambassador to Nato and now head of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, said it was “not unheard of for the Pentagon   the state department to be out of synch with the White House on foreign policy.  “What is new is a president who is so highly expressive of his stance. Statements used to be coordinated and agreed by the   process and that is not happening here. That’s what’s new. ”   Daniel Drezner, professor of international politics at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, said it was not uncommon for different parts of a US administration to play “good cop, bad cop” with foreign partners or rivals,  “In this case,” he added, “there doesn’t appear to a rational policy process, or if there is, it seems to exclude the president. ”  For the time being, Tillerson has been given the lead in brokering the Qatar   and Trump has not sent off inflammatory tweets or statements about it for two weeks.  However  —   unlike Mattis, to whom Trump has delegated unprecedented authority for deployments of US troops across the world and for framing strategy  —   Tillerson is a relatively weak figure in the administration, who shocked and alienated his own staff by backing cuts of nearly a third to the departmental budget.  “It’s a recipe for real problems if the actors in the region conclude that the state department has no voice in this and to look just to the White House for policy,” Drezner said. “The president still has overwhelming foreign policy authority. ” ",0,0,0,0,0,0,57

Bannon on Friday morning’s edition of Breitbart News Daily to talk about her new book, First Women: The Grace and Power of America’s Modern First Ladies. [Brower said Jackie Kennedy, featured on the cover of her book, was the model First Lady all of her successors “worship,” including Hillary Clinton.  “Hillary actually went to Jackie Kennedy and asked for advice on how to raise children in the White House,” she said.  “They were very close.  Jackie Kennedy never felt that other First Ladies really paid her the proper respect, until Hillary Clinton. ”  “The Clintons obviously went out of their way to talk about their connection with the Kennedys,” she continued, recalling “that famous photo of Bill Clinton shaking Kennedy’s hand in the Rose Garden. ” Bannon noted that the cultural power of the First Lady’s office has grown to the point where “they’re almost like CEOs,” requiring them to be “incredibly organized and really strategic in how they think. ” Brower agreed, offering Pat Nixon as an example. “I interviewed Pat Nixon’s chief of staff, and I really loved talking to people who were around Pat Nixon, because I knew very little about her,” she said.  “Her chief of staff said, ‘What First Lady is understood?  It’s the King, it’s not the Queen.’  This is as close as we have to a royal family, and the First Ladies are their husbands’ closest advisers, and you see, again and again, where they of course play pivotal roles. ”   “You think of Jackie Kennedy and Hillary Clinton, but also Laura Bush,” Brower said.  “She was somebody who, after dinner, would sit with George W. Bush and talk about what was going on in Afghanistan, and, you know, major world events. ”   “And then, of course, they’re criticized no matter what they do  —   by everybody, by different sectors of society.  There’s no way to please everybody. One First Lady told me she just did what she wanted to do because she knew she would get criticized no matter what.  They have this huge spotlight, but no job description,” she observed. Brower said her book is about “the sisterhood of these women, their empathy across party lines, and how they face these challenges of deciding how they’re going to approach the role of First Lady. ”   She said she found letters between the First Ladies that beautifully illustrated these strong relationships, including correspondence between Betty Ford, Nancy Reagan, and Barbara Bush.  Brower described the First Ladies as a “sorority of really intelligent women” whose friendships transcended intense partisan disputes.   In fact, she noted that “oftentimes the most difficult relationships are within the same party, because the primaries, as we see, are so heated. ”  She observed, for example, that Michelle Obama and Hillary Clinton “are not particularly close,” because “Michelle Obama finds it hard to forgive Hillary Clinton for what she said about her husband. ”  There was also some distance between Nancy Reagan and Barbara Bush, while Mrs. Bush has “befriended Michelle Obama. ” She expected the aftermath of the current presidential primary would be especially bitter, given the stress of the modern   news cycle and how the candidates’ wives have been “pitted against each other on Twitter, and things like that. ”   However, a bit of friction between the tough First Ladies of the past was not unheard of, such as Betty Ford’s famous comment that Rosalynn Carter “has a way of smiling while sticking a knife in your back. ”   As with her previous book, The Residence: Inside the Private World of the White House, Brower used the First Ladies as a means of offering a    look at the presidency, in the manner of popular TV shows like “Upstairs, Downstairs” and “Downton Abbey. ” “They would tell me that when a decision comes from the First Lady, they would say it comes from the ‘Second Floor,’” Brower said of her interviews with White House staff.  “Everyone was always worried about what the Second Floor was thinking.  I always thought that was interesting, because that’s the actual, literal private living quarters for the First Family. ” Brower said First Ladies exert a subtle influence on the election process, which isn’t always detected in polling, as voters consider the possibility of each woman entering the White House alongside her husband.  This is especially noticeable in the case of prospective First Gentleman and “ ” Bill Clinton.   She also assessed Melania Trump as “both an asset and a detriment, in some ways” to Donald Trump, because some women find her “very hard to relate to,” even though she isn’t the first former fashion model with aspirations to become First Lady.  “Pat Nixon and Betty Ford were both models, which is something a lot of people don’t know,” said Brower.  Mrs. Trump also wouldn’t be the first First Lady to be born outside the United States, having been preceded by Louisa Adams, born in London. She observed that First Ladies and families help to “humanize” presidential candidates. “If you saw those town halls on CNN, I think that really helped Donald Trump, because here’s a man with devoted children.  That whole thing really works for them.  I think that’s why you have to have children.  That’s the kind of expectation we have  —   a President and First Lady can’t really be childless, we don’t like that. ”   Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00AM to 9:00AM EST.

It quotes liberally from a host of professional life coaches, and includes tips from successful business leaders such as Sheryl Sandberg, Bill Gates and Steve Jobs. But it also includes illuminating pieces of advice from Ivanka herself, generated from a paradoxical lifestyle of enormous privilege combined with a grinding work ethic, and an outlook that simultaneously lifts women up while also   them. Given her role as a real estate executive in the family firm and leader of a fashion brand, Ivanka’s guide to navigating the workplace may have seemed unremarkable. But in her new embodiment as a White House adviser to her father, the president, her mission set out in the book appears glaringly at odds with the direction of the Trump administration  —   with or without her advice. Ivanka Trump writes early in the book: “Inspiring and empowering women who work  —   at all aspects of their lives  —   has been my mission throughout my entire career. Today I have the opportunity to take that work to new heights and advocate for change on a far greater scale than I’d ever imagined. ” She declares it her life’s mission to change society’s “ingrained negativity” about the image of the “working woman”. Here are Ivanka’s top 10 life hacks. Trump writes that she had been “grappling with whether being a young female executive with a baby would undermine my authority in the eyes of my colleagues and peers in a very   [real estate] industry” and had refrained from putting home life pictures on social media. But then: “I began to wonder whether I had been doing women who work a disservice by not owning the reality that, because I’ve got an infant, I’m in my bathrobe at 7AM and there’s pureed avocado all over me. ”  When working at her fashion brand and real estate offices in New York before her father became president: “I do all the things that must be accomplished face to face between the hours of 8am and 6pm. The rest I leave for later   …     after the kids have gone to bed   …     I start making the [office] rounds at 5. 30pm to check in and announce that I’m going home as I leave. My team knows   …     to expect emails from me at 11pm  —   and that I don’t expect an answer at that hour, unless they, like me, leave early!” Trump and Kushner observe the Jewish Sabbath. “The break is what enables me to go back to work, full steam, the following Monday   or, more realistically, Saturday night when I log back on!” “Design a life that honors your individual passions and priorities in a way only you can   …     What that looks like and how to achieve it is different for each and every one of us . .. Women like you and me are   …     owning who we are   …     We’re defining what it means to be a modern woman who works: for ourselves, our families, our companies, the culture at large and the generations to come. ” “During the [election] campaign, I went into survival mode: I worked and I was with my family I didn’t do much else. Honestly, I wasn’t treating myself to a massage or making much time for  . I wish I could have awoken early to meditate for twenty minutes and I would have loved to catch up with the friends I hadn’t seen in three months, but there just wasn’t enough time in the day. ” “Read a book or a magazine, power nap or meditate, listen to music, learn calligraphy, chess, cooking, a language or dancing   …     Gardening is our [family’s] new thing. Getting our hands dirty   …     it connects us with nature, gives me a great way to explain seasons to the kids and encourage healthy eating while having fun in the fresh air. On the weekends we hang out at our country home in New Jersey. ” “You can go off the grid completely during maternity leave and be totally within your rights, but staying in the loop and knowing that things are getting done may help you relax and focus on your baby   …     If you plan to be in touch [with the office] choose a day and time that’s consistently convenient for you (eg when your    is on newborn duty. )” “I was inspired to create the Women who Work initiative to change the conversation around work and family   …     It’s the ‘why’ behind the initiative and my brand that gets me out of bed at the crack of dawn every morning, and is what deeply motivates my team . .. it also means getting back to work once [the kids] are asleep and cranking until midnight or later. ” “I write a list for connecting with each of my kids. I put real thought into coming up with ideas for memorable moments I can create with each of them. I play cars with Joseph [the older of her two sons] on the floor, for 20 minutes each day. Arabella [her daughter and oldest of her three children] loves books, so I make a note to read at least two per day to her and plan ‘dates’ to the library   …     I draft a general family list that includes things like how often [my husband] Jared [Kushner, now senior adviser to president Donald Trump] and I will go on an official date night (every other week!)   …     I’ve built an entire system of symbols that denote how timely each item on my   list is. ” “Sometimes I like turning on Real Housewives and sitting in front of the TV eating a giant bowl of pasta with a glass of wine, but if I’m honest with myself, it’s kind of counterproductive. It is in these moments especially that we should meditate, soak in the tub, exercise or take a long walk   …     [Meanwhile,] I often hear things like ‘it’s so inspiring that you’re such a   mom’ and ‘So amazing! You’re not wearing makeup. I’m used to seeing you on The Apprentice in a powerful boardroom setting. ’” “I know lots of people who are outwardly successful and inwardly miserable  —   to me, that’s not success, but that’s the path they’ve chosen, consciously or not . .. You can’t change the [corporate] culture if you don’t ask  —   and you’re not going to get what you want if you aren’t creating high value for your company . .. Too often, for reasons like a lack of flexibility or poor support at home   at work, women are talking themselves out of great opportunities . .. One by one we must fight for ourselves, for our rights not just as workers but also as women. We must prioritize our families and passions, we must serve as role models . .. ” “I felt it was my duty and obligation to take a stand on issues that contribute to wage inequality, such as our country’s failure to mandate paid leave for American workers and the lack of safe, affordable   childcare . .. This is not a women’s issue, although mothers in particular are disproportionately affected . .. It is a family issue that affects men, women, children, and businesses nationwide . .. We need to fight for change. ”",0,0,0,0,0,0,59

61,61,4248,107707,161175,Trump’s Washington Hotel Draws Protesters — And Ethics Concerns,NPR,Jackie Northam,2017-01-19,2017.0,1.0,http://www.npr.org/2017/01/19/510480568/trumps-washington-hotel-draws-protesters-and-ethics-concerns,"On Friday, when Donald Trump puts his hand on a Bible and takes the oath of office, ethics experts say he may very well be in violation of a lease on one of his premier hotels. The Trump International Hotel is a grand dame of a building on Pennsylvania Avenue, just a stone’s throw from the White House. It has become something of a tourist destination in Washington  —   and a rallying point for protesters  —   since Trump won the election. This week, they snarled traffic in front of the hotel, and one demonstrator suffered serious burns after trying to set a fire outside the building. By Wednesday, two days before Inauguration Day, security guards stood behind barricades, allowing in only hotel patrons, specially invited guests and Trump himself, who stopped by Wednesday evening for dinner, as NPR’s Tamara Keith reports. An Instagram user who was there posted a video. Everyone else, including journalists, will have to wait until after the inauguration to get inside, guards said. But there’s other trouble for the hotel. Trump has a   lease with the U. S. General Services Administration (GSA) a government agency that owns the building where the hotel is located. The GSA contract explicitly says that no elected official of the government of the United States may hold that lease. Steven Schooner, a procurement specialist at George Washington University, says Trump will be in breach of that contract once he takes office. But he says Trump doesn’t seem to care. ”There is no evidence whatsoever to suggest that the Trump Organization has made any effort to resolve this problem in advance of the inauguration,” he says. Last week, Trump laid out his plans for restructuring his business empire while he’s in the White House. He said he would hold on to his roughly 500 business enterprises, spanning roughly 20 countries, but hand over    operations to his two adult sons. Trump also stated that he didn’t need to take these steps, as he would be insulated from any conflict of interest laws once he becomes president. While that’s true, he will be subject to the Emoluments Clause in the U. S. Constitution, which bars officeholders from accepting gifts from foreign governments without congressional approval. Schooner says if the Trump Organization holds on to the hotel lease, it sets up numerous conflicts of interest, even if Trump himself isn’t heading up daily operations. And once he becomes president, Trump will oversee the GSA  —   so he’ll be both landlord and tenant. Schooner says there are other problems, too. ”If foreign states, if lobbyists, special interest groups, pay price premiums at the Trump hotel to host their events, to stay and maybe rub elbows with the president’s children, that’s a problem,” he says. Trump’s lawyer, Sheri Dillon, disagrees. She said at a Jan. 11 press conference that people will not try to curry favor by staying at the hotel. ”Paying for a hotel room is not a gift or a present, and it has nothing to do with an office,” she said. Trump’s spokespeople declined NPR’s requests for comment. The GSA declined an interview. It said in a statement it needed more information from the Trump Organization about its new business structure before making a decision about the hotel lease.",0,0,0,0,0,0,61

"," Hackers affiliated with the Russian government have breached the Democratic National Committee’s computer network, gaining access to opposition research on presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump. DNC chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz called the incident ”serious” and says the committee moved quickly to ”kick out the intruders and secure our network. ” The chairwoman says the DNC reached out to the cyber firm CrowdStrike to help with the hack. The DNC says financial and personal information does not appear to have been accessed by the hackers. Related: America’s nuke program runs on floppy disks, The Washington Post, which first reported the incident, says that it was one of several targeting political organizations in the U. S. Citing committee officials and experts, the Washington Post reports that some of the hackers had access to the DNC network for about a year, but were all expelled over the past weekend. CrowdStrike told FoxNews. com that its Services team was engaged by the DNC to investigate an intrusion into its networks. “Following our investigation, we’ve determined that this was a sophisticated attack, conducted by adversaries affiliated with the Russian government, with the purpose of intelligence collection,” it said, in an emailed statement. “CrowdStrike has concluded with a high degree of confidence that the identified adversaries, Fancy Bear and Cozy Bear, are known perpetrators of cyber espionage and have previously targeted the White House, the State Department, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff,” it added. According to CrowdStrike, the hackers used advanced intrusion techniques to avoid detection and were looking for information in areas such as policy, political campaigns and strategies and foreign policy. Related: Senators move to block FBI from expanding hacking powers, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov denied Russian government involvement in the DNC hacking incident. State Dept. spokesman John Kirby told reporters that he only has press reports to go off of with respect to allegations that Russians hacked into the DNC for material related to Donald Trump so he would not confirm any hacking attempts.  He would only talk broadly about cyber hacks, saying the “U. S. government is the subject of countless cyber intrusions every day and it’s a concern we take seriously and it’s a concern we raise. ”  But Kirby said he was not aware of any conversations that had taken place on this topic.

63,63,33277,136739,206287,Trump is looking more and more like a man without a plan,Washington Post,Dana Milbank,2017-03-27,2017.0,3.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20170327235742/https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/trump-is-looking-more-and-more-like-a-man-without-a-plan/2017/03/27/327edc1c-1337-11e7-ada0-1489b735b3a3_story.html
"," Attorney General Jeff Sessions showed up unannounced in the White House briefing room to attempt something President Trump very much needed after Friday’s   debacle: a change of subject. Sessions, accompanied by White House press secretary Sean Spicer, revived one of the reliable applause lines from the campaign, a crackdown on “sanctuary cities” harboring illegal immigrants. “DUIs, assaults, burglaries, drug crimes, gang rapes, crimes against children and murders,” the attorney general recited. “Countless Americans would be alive today and countless loved ones would not be grieving today if these policies of sanctuary cities were ended. ” But for all the sturm und drang, Sessions didn’t have much to announce. “Sounds like you’re applying the standards and the policy that the Obama administration put forward,” CBS News’s Major Garrett observed when Sessions finished his statement. “Are you taking any additional steps?” “Well, that’s a good question,” Sessions replied. And the answer, apparently, is “no. ” Sessions said there could be additional requirements “in the future” beyond those the Obama administration had. But not just yet. Such policy anticlimaxes are becoming routine in Trump world. Tough rhetoric, big promises  —   and no substance. Trump looks more and more like a man without a plan. He promised he would have a   plan that would be cheaper and better than Obamacare and would cover just as many. But when it came time to deliver, he had nothing. He left the policy to House Speaker Paul Ryan, and the resulting proposal would have meant 24 million fewer people with health coverage. The bill collapsed in spectacular fashion under opposition from Democrats, moderate Republicans and conservatives  —   and Trump is blaming everybody but himself. During the campaign, he said he had a secret plan to defeat the Islamic State. He said he had a “foolproof” plan of “defeating them quickly and effectively and having total victory. ” Now, it turns out, he has no plan. He has asked the Pentagon to create one. “We will figure something out,” he said last week. Vowing to keep Americans safe at home, he originally promised “a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States,” before tempering that campaign promise to the restricting of travelers from certain countries. But since administration lawyers tried to put that vague notion into an actual policy, his attempts at imposing a “travel ban” have been repeatedly shot down in court. Next up after the   failure is Trump’s promise to enact “historic” tax reform. But now that it’s time to present a policy, the promise looks more histrionic than historic. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has said he wants to have legislation in August, but Spicer on Monday was backpedaling. “I know that Secretary Mnuchin has talked about August as a target date, and I think it depends,” Spicer said in response to a question from Alexis Simendinger from RealClearPolitics. He added that “this is going to be dependent on whether, how, the degree to which we can come to consensus on a lot of big issues. ” And he concluded, “So, you know, we’re not  —   we’re not there yet. ” During the campaign, Trump boldly vowed that he would eliminate the U. S. debt, now about $20 trillion, during his term. He then said he would cut the debt in half. But when CNBC’s Eamon Javers asked about whether Trump would allow tax reform to add to the deficit (and therefore the debt) Spicer said it was “really early” to be raising such questions. “You’re asking really early in the process to make that kind of analysis before we have a policy set forth,” he protested. How presumptuous to expect Trump, after campaigning on historic tax reform, actually to have a proposal! The emerging evidence that Trump doesn’t have a plan for much of anything isn’t entirely bad. No plan is better than a bad plan. In theory, at least, this means Trump could change course. And Spicer, expanding on remarks Trump made after the   bill collapsed Friday, said the president was ready to work with Democrats. “There may be other opportunities to work with people across the aisle,” he said, later adding that “if Democrats want to join in, then that’s great and we’ll do that. ” ABC News’s Jonathan Karl noted that such behavior would “require a serious change of course for the president. ” “To some degree, sure,” Spicer readily replied. But Trump has never demonstrated an ability to change, and even if he could, some of his top advisers would resist him, many Republicans in Congress would revolt, and Trump’s supporters would be furious. Having actual policies may just not be part of this president’s plan.

[Whilst Congress passed 211 laws over the course of the year, they had an accompanying 3, 852 new federal regulations, costing billions of dollars in both implementation and losses to businesses. This was 443 more regulations than 2015.  There was also a record number of pages of red tape, with 97, 110 pages printed on the 2016 Federal Register. However the level of regulation per new law passed is still down considerably compared to  2013, when the Obama administration introduced 3659 new regulations for just 72 new laws, a record 51 pieces of regulation for every new law. The record for overall new regulation is still held by George. W. Bush in 2003, who introduced 4148 new rules to improve security following the   terror attacks, 21 one pieces of regulation for every law. However, the report states that “the multiple [of number of regulations per law passed] did tend to be higher during Obama administration. Bush’s eight years averaged 20, while Obama’s   have averaged 29. ” “There’s no pattern to any of this, since the numerators and denominators can vary widely there had been 114 laws in 2015, and a multiple of 39. The multiple can be higher with fewer laws, or with more regulations, holding the other constant. The point is that agencies do the bulk of lawmaking, no matter the party in power,” the report continued. Throughout the election campaign,   Donald Trump promised to cut taxation as well as much federal regulation that has risen under Obama.

65,65,35553,139015,209152,What do we want Hillary Clinton to do about her husband?,Washington Post,Alyssa Rosenberg,2016-01-12,2016.0,1.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20160113011555/http://washingtonpost.com/news/act-four/wp/2016/01/12/what-do-we-want-hillary-clinton-to-do-about-her-husband/
","     Bill Clinton’s sexual misadventures have never quite vanished as a national story. But in recent weeks, Republican presidential contender Donald Trump has called renewed attention to them, and Juanita Broaddrick, who in 1999 said Bill Clinton had raped her in 1978, has renewed those allegations. Both because the case is past the statute of limitations in Arkansas and because Hillary Clinton is running for president now on a platform that includes greater support for rape victims, the headlines have become more about Hillary Clinton than about her husband, the man who actually has been accused of misconduct. But though the circumstances are different, the question remains the same: What is it we want Hillary Clinton to do about her husband? Because however unfair or incoherent that desire is, Americans seem to want her to do something. In a great post published last week, my colleague Greg Sargent got at the incoherence that lies behind the idea that Bill Clinton’s sexual history is “fair game” during the 2016 presidential election. Does “fair game” mean that “Bill Clinton’s past sexual indiscretions are a legitimate topic for political debate in and of themselves, as a way of discrediting Bill Clinton, in his capacity as a surrogate for Hillary Clinton, a role which he is undoubtedly playing? Or does it mean that,” Sargent asked, “Bill Clinton’s past sexual indiscretions are a legitimate weapon to use against Hillary Clinton, which is to say, as something that undermines Hillary Clinton’s claim to being a lifelong advocate for women and her argument that her policies are better for women than those of Republicans are?” Rebecca Traister, answering the latter assumption and examining the Clinton marriage in the context of the saga of Camille and Bill Cosby, traced the long history of making women responsible for the private lives and private acts of their very public husbands. “The position she is being put in is emblematic of the double binds placed on wives in all kinds of circumstances,” Traister wrote. “Husbands act; wives react to them. Husbands behave poorly; people look to wives for explanations of why. Wives pay prices for goods they never bought; they do time in publicity hell for actions they never took; they receive judgments for crimes they did not commit. They are offered impossible choices: Do they condemn their partners and thereby destroy the legacies and legitimacy they have helped to build, and if they do not, do they become culpable in those partners’ misdeeds?” If we haven’t been able to articulate that in real life, fiction has imagined a number of ways Hillary Clinton might deal with her more frustrating half. In both Joe Klein’s initially anonymous novel “Primary Colors” and the Mike Nichols 1998 film adaptation of the book, the answer seems to be that we’d like the satisfaction of knowing that Hillary Clinton is a mess. In “Primary Colors,” the   for the Clintons are Jack and Susan Stanton (John Travolta and Emma Thompson) and their transgressions are rather more baroque than even the most dramatic things Bill Clinton has actually been accused of. Jack carries on an affair with Susan’s hairdresser. He sleeps with the    daughter of a family friend, and when she becomes pregnant, there is some suggestion that Jack might be the father. Susan has sex with a campaign aide, Henry Burton (Adrian Lester) as revenge. And it later emerges that she has sometimes slept with Libby Holden (Kathy Bates) the family’s wartime consigliere, in similar moments of emotional pain. Nobody in the novel seems to want Susan to leave Jack; at the beginning of the novel, her faith in him is part of what makes Jack seem intellectually credible. And for much of the novel, their marriage seems, from the outside, to be defined by what Henry refers to as “the mysterious emotional concavity of their bond: the most blatant transgressions often had to be ignored. ” But as Jack’s flaws become too obvious for us, and for Henry, to deny, Susan takes on a different role in the action. Now, her job is to be the person who acknowledges that terrible things have taken place, but that Jack is still worth supporting anyway. She slaps her husband, she comforts the mother of the young girl Jack had sex with, she has revenge sex of her own. Susan punishes Jack so that we don’t have to, and she suffers along with us. She’s the bridge between our moral horror over Jack’s actions and our emotional desire to fall for his charm and promise. “Political Animals,” Greg Berlanti’s spritely 2012 miniseries, follows a former first lady, Elaine Barrish (Sigourney Weaver) who must confront her choice to stay with her philandering husband, Bud (Ciarán Hinds) after she loses her own run for the presidency. If “Primary Colors” was primarily concerned with Jack Stanton’s political fate, “Political Animals” prioritizes Elaine, its Hillary Clinton  . If Susan had to stay with Jack to get him elected, “Political Animals” sees Bud as dead weight on Elaine’s promising career and   sexual charisma. She dumps him, becomes secretary of state, flirts with foreign diplomats  —   and seizes her second chance at the presidency when it comes along. Bud’s philandering doesn’t have victims, as far as we can tell; there’s no abuse of power, no allegations of statutory rape or rape. Rather, the question is one of  : Why would a woman like Elaine  —   or Hillary Clinton  —   stay with a man who keeps putting her in a position to be embarrassed, who drags his mud all over her outstanding promise? These questions might be easier to answer in fiction than in life, but only marginally. The only sure thing is that Hillary and Bill Clinton chose each other a long time ago and have been choosing each other ever since. What we project onto their relationship says as much about us, and how our thinking about marriage and gender roles has changed, as it does about the Clintons’ private feelings and compromises. And given how exposed and examined the Clintons have been during their decades in the national spotlight, that’s the only thing about them that may remain forever mysterious.",0,0,0,0,0,0,65

Clinton said,“It matters to me that my mom also recognizes the role the Supreme Court has when it comes to gun control. With Justice Scalia on the bench, one of the few areas where the Court actually had an inconsistent record relates to gun control. Sometimes the Court upheld local and state gun control measures as being compliant with the Second Amendment and sometimes the Court struck them down. So if you listen to Moms Demand Action and the Brady Campaign and the major efforts pushing for smart, sensible and enforceable gun control across our country, disclosure, have endorsed my mom, they say they believe the next time the Court rules on gun control, it will make a definitive ruling. So it matters to me that my mom is the only person running for president who not only constantly makes that connection but also has a strong record on gun control and standing up to the NRA. This is one of those issues I didn’t know I could care more about until I became a mother. And I think every day about the Sandy Hook families whose children every day, don’t come home from school.

","     For a moment there, it looked as if “Saturday Night Live” was going to focus its cold open last night on the   debate.

But, really, the whole thing is one long   moment. And then there’s Kate    Clinton, whose debate prep session has basically turned into a victory party and who tries to tell CNN that she’s very saddened by Trump’s comments  —   but can’t stop smiling.

68,68,27152,130614,196520,This New York Times correction shows what Trump’s war on the media actually looks like,Vox,Yochi Dreazen,2017/2/27,2017.0,2.0,http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/2/27/14749650/spicer-trump-lie-press-enemy-of-the-people-war-on-the-media," In the annals of New York Times corrections, this one is a doozy:    Correction: February 25, 2017Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to Sean Spicer’s upbringing. He was New England bred, having been raised in Rhode Island; he was not “New England born. ” (Mr. Spicer would not go on the record and give the correct facts pertaining to his birthplace.) The subject of the story  —   President Donald Trump’s struggles with the aggressive Washington press corps  —   is actually less important than what that correction tells you about his administration’s treatment of the media. It is a clear illustration of how Trump’s continuing verbal war on the media plays out in real time. Read that last sentence again. The White House press secretary  —   whose sole job is to communicate with the media  —   refused to answer questions about where he was born.    You can imagine a parallel universe where Spicer, like most past press secretaries of both parties, might have refused to comment about sensitive issues of national security.     But that wasn’t what happened here. Spicer  —   memorably portrayed by Melissa McCarthy on Saturday Night Live as a raging, nearly unhinged bully  —   refused to answer a basic and anodyne question about his biography. This came just days after Spicer drew widespread condemnation for pointedly excluding several mainstream media outlets, including the Times, from a routine gaggle with reporters.     It’s easy to focus on Trump’s nonstop series of attacks on the press, which he now regularly describes as an “enemy of the people. ” But Spicer illustrates something much less   but in some ways just as dangerous: a White House that refuses to answer basic questions. To be fair, when they do answer questions, many of those answers turn out to be false.    Spicer had recently taken to Twitter to deny a report by CBS’s Major Garrett that said Trump’s nominee to run the Navy was set to withdraw from consideration. On Sunday, the nominee, Philip Bilden, did just that. As my colleague Matt Yglesias notes:  If the press secretary habitually tells obvious lies (like about Inauguration Day crowd sizes) or says   things that later turn out to be false (like indignantly denying Garrett’s story) then he ends up like the proverbial boy who cried wolf. Spicer, like his boss, routinely uses his lectern to bash the press or knowingly utter falsehoods. But he’s doing something else here: not lying so much as simply refusing to do a basic part of his job.  The problems that kind of refusal causes are magnified exponentially by the fact that key agencies like the Pentagon and State Department still don’t have   press people, which means in many cases the only place reporters can go for information is the White House itself.  Take the State Department, which as I wrote last week has largely suspended its normal interactions with the press. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has yet to meet with reporters, and the daily press conferences the department has held since the 1950s haven’t taken place for more than a month.  With no other spokespeople to turn to, reporters across Washington have little choice but to turn to Spicer. As the New York Times was just reminded, Sean Spicer seems to have very little interest in helping them do even basic parts of their jobs.    That’s a problem now; it will be a much bigger and more dangerous one when there’s an actual crisis that leaves average Americans clamoring for accurate information. Unless something changes, this White House may be unable, or unwilling, to give it to them.   Watch: Covering a White House that isn’t afraid to lie     ",0,0,0,0,0,0,68
69,69,33099,136561,206071,Intelligence chairman: Justice report shows no evidence for Trump’s claims of wiretapping during campaign,Washington Post,Mike DeBonis,2017-03-19,2017.0,3.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20170320004030/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2017/03/19/no-new-evidence-to-support-trumps-wiretap-claims-house-intelligence-chairman-says/
","     The Republican chairman and ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee said Sunday thatnew documents provided to Congress by the Justice Department provided no proof to support President Trump’s claim that his predecessor had ordered wiretaps of Trump Tower. “Was there a physical wiretap of Trump Tower? No, but there never was, and the information we got on Friday continues to lead us in that direction,” Rep. Devin Nunes ( .) the chairman, said on “Fox News Sunday. ” He added, “There was no FISA warrant that I’m aware of to tap Trump Tower”  —   a reference to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, a federal law that governs the issuance of search warrants in U. S. intelligence gathering.   [How hard is it to get an intelligence wiretap? Pretty hard.]   Rep. Adam Schiff (Calif.) the panel’s top Democrat, also said there is no proof of a wiretap: “We are at the bottom of this: There is nothing at the bottom. ” Nunes and Schiff spoke a day before their panel is scheduled to have its first public hearing on alleged Russian attempts to interfere in last year’s presidential election  —   a subject that is certain to include discussion of contacts between Trump campaign figures and Russian operatives. Trump’s first national security adviser, Michael Flynn, resigned last month after it was revealed that he had privately discussed U. S. sanctions with the Russian ambassador to Washington before Trump took office.      A day before FBI Director James B. Comey appears before the House Intelligence Committee, Republican and Democratic lawmakers on March 19 said they yet have to see any evidence to support President Trump’s claim that former president Barack Obama ordered a wiretap on him in 2016. (Bastien   Washington Post)   Schiff, speaking on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” said he expects FBI Director James B. Comey to testify clearly at the hearing that there is no factual basis for Trump’s wiretapping claims. “I hope that we can put an end to this wild goose chase, because what the president said was just patently false,” the Democrat said. “It’s continuing to grow in terms of damage, and he needs to put an end to this. ” Comey privately told lawmakers last week that there is no basis whatsoever for Trump’s claim. “It was a categorical denial,” said a U. S. official familiar with the matter.​ The FBI chief is expected to say so publicly on Monday. Although they agreed on the wiretapping claims, Nunes and Schiff did not agree on whether the question of collusion between Trump campaign figures and Russian operatives has been settled. Nunes said the new Justice Department documents, submitted Friday in response to a congressional request, included “no evidence of collusion” to swing the election in Trump’s favor and repeated previous statements that there is no credible proof that there was any active coordination. The lawmaker said he remains primarily concerned about leaks of U. S. surveillance of conversations between Flynn and Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. “That’s the only crime we know has been committed right now,” Nunes said. But Schiff said there was “circumstantial evidence of collusion” at the outset of the congressional investigations into purported Russian election meddling, as well as “direct evidence” that Trump campaign figures sought to deceive the public about their interactions with Russian figures. “Of course, there’s one thing to say there’s evidence; there’s another thing to say we can prove this or prove it beyond a reasonable doubt,” he said. “But there was certainly enough for us to conduct an investigation. The American people have a right to know, and in order to defend ourselves, we need to know whether the circumstantial evidence of collusion and direct evidence of deception is indicative of more. ” Trump last week refused to back down from his tweets on March 4 that claimed President Barack Obama “had my ‘wires tapped’ in Trump Tower just before the victory” and compared it to McCarthyism and the Watergate scandal. But no credible evidence has emerged to support those claims, and the top Republican and Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee said last week that they have seen nothing that supports the allegation. In a Fox News Channel interview on Thursday, Trump said, “I think you’re going to find some very interesting items coming to the forefront over the next two weeks. ” Nunes said Trump could be referring to new information about whether intelligence officials “unmasked,” or identified, U. S. citizens who were captured speaking with foreign officials who are under routine surveillance  —   a process governed by FISA. “That is very possible, and we don’t have the answers to those questions yet,” he said. “We had a deadline of Friday for the NSA, FBI and CIA to get us those names that were unmasked through the FISA system. We didn’t get those names on Friday, and until we get those names, we can’t rule this out. ” He added that Monday’s hearing is “just the beginning” and that he plans to continue looking into who revealed Flynn’s communications with Kislyak. “We’re trying to get to everyone who, for lack of a better term, was at the crime scene,” he said. “We’re trying to bring them all in, see what they knew, when they knew it, if they knew about the leaks, if they knew about General Flynn’s name being unmasked. These are all questions that we need to get to the bottom of. ” Trump remains under pressure from members of his own party to back off his claims of illegal wiretapping  —   particularly after the furor intensified last week when White House press secretary Sean Spicer suggested that British intelligence might have played a role in the surveillance. Spicer later apologized for the claim and explained that he had repeated an unverified media report.   [Britain: White House says it won’t repeat claims that a British agency wiretapped Trump]   Matthew Olsen, a former head of intelligence programs at the Justice Department’s National Security Division and a former general counsel of the National Security Agency, said a claim like Trump’s is “destructive on a couple of levels. ” One, a false claim that the FBI is engaged in illegal activity  —   acting on a president’s order to wiretap a presidential candidate  —   “erodes the relationship between the White House and the intelligence community. ” But more fundamentally, he said, insisting on such a claim “also erodes public confidence in what comes out of the White House. ”​ On ABC’s “This Week,” another Republican on the House Intelligence Committee called on Trump to apologize for accusing Obama of ordering an illegal wiretap. “To quote my    father   …     it never hurts to say you’re sorry,” said Rep. Will Hurd (Tex.) a former clandestine agent for the CIA. “I think it helps with our allies. We’ve got to make sure that we’re all working together. We live in a very dangerous world, and we can’t do this alone.   …     It’s not just sorry to the president, but also to the U. K. for the claims or the intimation that the U. K. was involved in this, as well. It doesn’t hurt. And it takes away from the rest of his agenda. ” Hurd said that “some folks will probably be frustrated” by the hearing Monday because the officials set to testify, including Comey, might not be able to elaborate on investigative matters: “There may be an active investigation going on, a criminal investigation. And if there’s an active criminal investigation, we need to allow law enforcement   …     do their job. ” In a separate interview on “This Week,” Sen. Rand Paul ( .) focused on the leak of Flynn’s communications with Kislyak and said those within the federal government who might have been responsible should undergo   tests. “It is very, very important that whoever released that go to jail, because you cannot have members of the intelligence community listening to the most private and highly classified information and then releasing that to the New York Times,” Paul said. “There can only be a certain handful of people who did that. I would bring them all in. They would have to take   tests. And, I would say, including the political people, because some political people knew about this as well. ” Paul said, using a term increasingly favored by conservatives for members of the federal bureaucracy, “You will get a ‘deep state.’ You will have an intelligence community that has enormous power if that happens. ” Hurd, however, pushed back on the notion that a deep state was seeking to undermine Trump. “I spent nine and a half years as an undercover officer. I was the dude in the back alleys at 4 in the morning collecting intelligence to protect our homeland,” he said. “The men and the women in the CIA, they do their job regardless of who is in the White House. Same for NSA. Same for FBI. These men and women are putting themselves in harm’s way. ” If true, the alleged campaign of political interference by Russia, Hurd said, would “go down in the history of Mother Russia as the greatest covert action campaign” it had ever pursued. “It created a wedge, whether real or perceived, between the White House, the intelligence community and the American public,” he said. “And that’s why, as we go through this review and investigation, it has to be bipartisan. It has to be thorough. And it has to be thoughtful, because we are feeding into this   narrative that the Russians are trying to create. ” Ellen Nakashima contributed to this report.",0,0,0,0,0,0,69

Morris said, “You know, I’ve been there. It is the way to absolutely mess with Hillary’s mind.

73,73,37611,38767,57616,Clinton expresses regret for saying ’half’ of Trump supporters are ’deplorables’,CNN,Dan Merica,2016-09-10,2016.0,9.0,,"New York (CNN) Hillary Clinton expressed ”regret” Saturday for comments in which she said ”half” of Donald Trump’s supporters are ”deplorables,” meaning people who are racist, sexist, homophobic or xenophobic. ”Last night I was ’grossly generalistic,’ and that’s never a good idea. I regret saying ’half’    that was wrong,” Clinton said in a statement in which she also vowed to call out ”bigotry” in Trump’s campaign. The Democratic presidential nominee sparked an uproar late Friday when she described Trump’s supporters at a fundraiser. ”To just be grossly generalistic, you can put half of Trump supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables,” Clinton said. ”Right? Racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamaphobic, you name it.”  She added: ”And unfortunately, there are people like that and he has lifted them up. He has given voice to their websites that used to only have 11, 000 people, now have 11 million. He tweets and retweets offensive, hateful,   rhetoric.” Clinton then said some of these people were ”irredeemable” and ”not America.” She described the rest of his supporters as people who are looking for change in any form because of economic anxiety and urged her supporters to empathize with them. The Democratic presidential nominee made similar comments in an interview Thursday with an Israeli television station. But when they were widely reported Friday night, Trump and Republicans quickly pounced on the remarks, which drew comparisons to President Barack Obama’s comments about clinging to ”guns and religion” at a 2008 campaign fundraiser and Mitt Romney’s ”47 percent” remark in 2012. ”Isn’t it disgraceful that Hillary Clinton makes the worst mistake of the political season and instead of owning up to this grotesque attack on American voters, she tries to turn it around with a pathetic rehash of the words and insults used in her failing campaign?” Trump said in a statement. ”For the first time in a long while, her true feelings came out, showing bigotry and hatred for millions of Americans.” Trump’s running mate, Mike Pence, forcefully condemned Clinton ”in the strongest possible terms” Saturday at the Values Voter Summit in Washington. ”The truth of the matter is that the men and women who support Donald Trump’s campaign are   Americans, farmers, coal miners, teachers, veterans, members of our law enforcement community, members of every class of this country, who know that we can make America great again,” Pence said. ”Let me just say, from the bottom of my heart, Hillary, they are not a basket of anything,” Pence continued. ”They are Americans and they deserve your respect.” Clinton had earlier divided Trump’s supporters into ”two big baskets,” what she called ”the deplorables,” in an interview with Channel 2 News Israel that aired Thursday. ”If I were to be grossly generalistic, I would say you can take Trump supporters and put them in two big baskets,” Clinton said. ”There are what I call the deplorables    the racists, you know, the haters, and the people who are drawn because they think somehow he’s going to restore an America that no longer exists. So just eliminate them from your thinking, because we’ve always had an annoying prejudicial element within our politics.” Clinton made the comments before introducing Barbra Streisand at an LGBT fundraiser in downtown New York.  According to average ticket prices and attendance figures provided by the campaign, Clinton raised around $6 million at the fundraiser, at which some attendees paid $50, 000. In seizing upon the comments, Trump used the opportunity to do some fundraising as well. ”Now is the time to show Hillary the consequences of her words,” Trump’s campaign wrote in an appeal to supporters. ”I’m asking you and the millions of   patriotic Americans whom she just insulted, to fight back with a contribution of $100, $65, $50, $35, $25, $15, or even $5 to elect Donald Trump to the White House.” Clinton expresses regret, In her statement Saturday, Clinton was emphatic in condemning what she said was Trump’s racially insensitive campaign. She listed a series of controversial moments from Trump’s campaign, including his fight with a Muslim Gold Star family, criticism of a federal US judge of Mexican heritage and his insinuation that Obama wasn’t born in the US. ”I won’t stop calling out bigotry and racist rhetoric in this campaign,” Clinton said. She also noted her comments about empathizing with other Trump supporters. ”As I said, many of Trump’s supporters are   Americans who just don’t feel like the economy or our political system are working for them,” Clinton said. ”I’m determined to bring our country together and make our economy work for everyone, not just those at the top. Because we really are ’stronger together. ’” Around the same time Clinton issued her statement, Trump also made a case for unity. ”While Hillary said horrible things about my supporters, and while many of her supporters will never vote for me, I still respect them all!” Trump said on Twitter. A senior Democrat close to the campaign told CNN it wants to have a conversation about what it sees as the racism in Trump’s campaign, but could not have that part of the conversation until Clinton backed away from the ”half” comment. The Democrat added that Clinton’s concession drew a contrast with Trump. ”She can admit when she is wrong    Trump never does,” the Democrat said. ’Prejudice and paranoia’ Clinton’s comments amounted to startlingly blunt talk for a candidate who is usually measured in her assessment of the Republican nominee. Although Clinton has accused Trump of racism before, she has never explicitly called him a racist. Last month, she delivered a major speech in which she accused Trump of aligning himself with   extremists and saying he ”built his campaign on prejudice and paranoia.” ”He’s taking hate groups mainstream and helping a radical fringe take over the Republican Party,” Clinton said in Reno, Nevada. ”His disregard for the values that make our country great is profoundly dangerous.” Nick Merrill, a spokesman for Clinton’s campaign, cited the speech in attempting to clarify the Democratic nominee’s comments Friday night. ”Obviously not everyone supporting Trump is part of the alt right, but alt right leaders are with Trump,” Merrill tweeted, adding, ”And their supporters appear to make up half his crowd when you observe the tone of his events.” Clinton’s campaign was continuing to dig in Saturday morning as outrage swirled over the comment, though surrogates were emphasizing that Clinton was talking about Trump’s supporters    people who attend his rallies    and not Trump voters, a larger group, in the eyes of the campaign, that includes more moderate Republicans. Vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine told The Washington Post that Clinton’s statement didn’t require an apology. ”She said, ’Look, I’m generalizing here, but a lot of his support is coming from this odd place, that he’s given a platform to the   and white nationalists,’” Kaine told the newspaper. ”But then she went on to say, ’Look, there’s also a number of his supporters that have economic anxieties, and we’ve got to speak to those. ’” Added Kaine: ”There are supporters we’re not going to get.” Tyrone Gale, a Clinton spokesman, rejected Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway’s call on Twitter for an apology by tweeting a New York Times video depicting vulgar and obscene comments made by some Trump supporters at his rallies. And Bakari Sellers, a Clinton surrogate and CNN contributor, was defiant when asked about the remark. ”This election is about beating back bigotry and hate,” Sellers said in an interview. ”Whether it’s 10% or 50% Donald Trump and his supporters have elevated it. If you’re not a bigot, her comments shouldn’t offend you.” The Clinton campaign directed surrogates on Saturday night to push the press if asked about the ”basket of deplorables” comment, according to a talking points obtained by CNN. ”I think we can all agree that if Donald Trump said something controversial about Clinton supporters, it wouldn’t have been in his top 10 list of offensive statements in a day. It’s well past time the press stopped grading Trump on a curve,” the talking points said. ”So is the press going to cover this story in the right contact, or are they going to hold Hillary to a different standard again?”  #BasketofDeplorables, The controversy recalled rhetorical stumbles in previous campaigns. In 2008, Obama told an audience at a closed fundraiser that decades of lost jobs and unfulfilled promises from Washington had left some Pennsylvanians ”bitter” and clinging ”to guns or religion or antipathy to people who aren’t like them or   sentiment or   sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations.” He later acknowledged that the comment was ”boneheaded.” And late in the 2012 campaign, Romney, the GOP nominee, was memorably caught in a secretly recorded video telling donors that ”there are 47 percent of the people who will vote for the President no matter what,” saying they ”believe they are victims, who believe that government has the responsibility to care for them. Who believe that they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing.” Romney later told reporters the comments were ”not elegantly stated.” Trump himself invoked the gaffe to slam Clinton Saturday night, also retweeting Obama’s remark four years ago that ”We need a President who is fighting for all Americans, not one who writes off nearly half the country.” What separates Obama and Romney’s comments from Clinton’s, however, is that they believed their remarks were private. Clinton’s event on Friday was only the sixth out of the more than 330 fundraisers she’s attended as a candidate that was open to the press. Almost immediately, ”#BasketofDeplorables” began trending on Twitter, and conservatives and Trump supporters were predictably outraged. ”The truly deplorable thing in this race is the shameful level of condescension  disrespect @HillaryClinton’s showing to her fellow citizens,” Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said on Twitter. Conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt suggested Trump open each speech by asking his crowds, ”So, which half of you are in the #basketofdeplorables?” Weekly Standard editor Bill Kristol, a notable Trump critic, tweeted, ”Hillary Clinton’s creed: ’All men are created equal’    except for those I’ve consigned to the basket of deplorables, who are irredeemable.” Even some Democrats noted the political opportunity Clinton had given Republicans. ”’Basket of deplorables’ reminds me of ’binders full of women.’ Equally tone deaf statements divorced from reality,” tweeted Lis Smith, Obama’s director of rapid response during his 2012 campaign.  David Axelrod, a former chief strategist to Obama who is now a CNN commentator, referenced the controversy over Obama’s ”guns and religion” line at a 2008 fundraiser, tweeting, ”Fundraiser remarks are treacherous things.” Speaking to CNN’s Michael Smerconish Saturday morning, Bob Beckel, who managed Walter Mondale’s 1984 presidential campaign, offered no defense of Clinton. ”It’s the wrong thing to say,” Beckel said.",0,0,0,0,0,0,73

","      The night Donald Trump notched his first win as a presidential candidate, he took the stage in New Hampshire between Ivanka and Melania and lit into the special interests that he declared had corrupted Washington  —   the company town that Trump, marketer extraordinaire, has ruthlessly trashed to the benefit of his own brand. “These are lobbyists, these are people that don’t necessarily love our country,” said Trump. “We have to stop it. We have to stop it. ” Over Trump’s shoulder, another   man licked his teeth and flattened his lips into a straight line. He appeared out of place on that stage, and he seemed to know it. His face oscillated between forced smiles and blank stares, like Dustin Hoffman at the end of “The Graduate. ” This would be Donald F. McGahn II, the former chairman of the Federal Election Commission, Trump’s campaign lawyer and unofficial liaison to the Washington establishment his client was gleefully trashing. It’s possible to read too much into the expressions of the men who stand behind Trump. (Did Chris Christie really feel like a hostage, or is that just what his face always looks like?) And yet one had to wonder what McGahn, who had skillfully outmaneuvered those who had tried to get Trump thrown off the New Hampshire ballot, really felt about his presence in the campaign’s antiestablishment tableau. McGahn is one of the top election lawyers in the country, a job so highly specialized that its practitioners are almost unavoidably “Washington insiders” by definition. He is credited as one of the people most responsible for loosening regulations on campaign spending, an enabler of the corporate electioneering against which Trump has defined his candidacy. His wife, Shannon McGahn, is staff director for the House Financial Services Committee, a role that makes her a magnet for the very lobbyists that Trump regularly pillories. As a possible convention fight looms, Trump has attempted to professionalize his campaign, hiring veteran lobbyist Paul Manafort, who wrangled Gerald Ford’s delegates in 1976. But it’s been years since Manafort lived full time in the District, and he remains a mystery to the K Street set. That makes McGahn the most entrenched Beltway insider in a campaign run by outsiders who owe their careers to Trump  —   which means McGahn may have the most to lose by appearing in frame with the candidate as he lobs bombs on the nation’s capital.   [Inside Trump’s inner circle, his staffers are willing to fight for him. Literally.]  The chatter among his fellow Republican operatives hit a fever pitch when McGahn made his onstage debut with Trump. “It’s one thing to represent him as a lawyer,” said one, “but why would he lend his visual credibility to Trump in such a way that could damage his reputation for the long term?” Then again, if any member of the “establishment” would be willing to gamble on a Donald Trump presidency, there are plenty of reasons why it would be Don McGahn.   In the 1980s, a young Donald Trump had his sights set on a different kingdom to conquer.  Atlantic City had recently passed legislation to allow casinos, and Trump wanted a piece of the action. Doing so required a power broker, someone who understood the intricacies of both the law and local political forces. So Trump turned to a portly Irish American lawyer named Patrick McGahn  —   “Paddy” to his friends, and Uncle Pat to his nephew Don. Paddy, the son of a shopkeeper and recipient of three Purple Hearts from the Korean War, was known to have the best professional connections in town, and the high legal fees worthy of them. As Trump gobbled up real estate, Paddy paved the way. When Trump was seeking city approval to build an employee parking lot at Trump Castle, Paddy threw a party for the mayor’s wife, inviting about 16 people aboard the Trump Princess yacht and taking them out to a dinner at one of the casino’s gourmet restaurants, according to news reports at the time. When Trump purchased property from two brothers with Mafia ties, he paid double the value, according to Wayne Barrett’s book, “Trump: The Deals and the Downfall,” and put the title in the name of Paddy’s secretary before transferring it to one of his corporate entities. There was no problem too big or too small for Paddy, who once represented Trump in a fight with a vendor selling hot dogs outside a Trump property. Trump was so appreciative that he named a cocktail lounge for him at the Taj Mahal in Atlantic City: Paddy’s Saloon. The dealmaker didn’t even mind paying top price, according to John R. O’Donnell, former president of the Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino. In his book, “Trumped! ,” O’Donnell recounted the time he complained to his boss about McGahn’s exorbitant fees. “Jack, I’m 13 and 0 with this guy,” Trump said. “What do you want me to do? He gets things done in this town. ” Did Trump recognize a name he could trust when he decided to hire Don McGahn to get things done in This Town? McGahn did not respond to repeated requests for an interview, nor did the Trump campaign. “I got to believe that Trump came to Don because of Pat, that’s got to be the connection,” said Bill Pascrell III, a lobbyist who worked on behalf of Trump casinos for more than a decade. “When Trump needed an election lawyer, I doubt he just Googled ‘good election lawyers.’ ”    McGahn during his tenure as on the Federal Election Commission in April 2013, when he was known for loosening many campaign finance regulations. (Bill O’  Washington Post)  Even if he had, he could easily have landed on McGahn. There aren’t many   election lawyers, and even fewer with a résumé as strong as McGahn’s.  At the FEC, he frustrated campaign finance reform advocates by pushing to minimize government oversight; the commission’s top lawyer resigned when McGahn attempted to keep his office from sharing information with federal prosecutors. But he also won praise for opening up many formerly   deliberations. He later moved on to the   practice at the law firm Patton Boggs LLP and spent nearly 10 years as counsel for the National Republican Congressional Committee. Currently, he hangs his hat at Jones Day, another   law firm. Despite McGahn’s establishment bona fides, he makes a surprisingly good fit with the insurgent candidate. “I could see them getting along,” said Jack Deschauer, who worked with McGahn at Patton Boggs. “Don’s a straight shooter, tells it like it is, and isn’t at all stuck up. ” He’s always been a bit of an iconoclast. Until recently he kept his hair long, and he still plays bass in an ’80s cover band that gigs in Ocean City, Md. While many of his colleagues boast Ivy League diplomas, McGahn got his law degree from Pennsylvania’s Widener University. Like Trump, he’s something of an outsider no matter how far inside he gets.  [Cable news, a welcoming home for the weary   staffer]  But there’s another reason McGahn may have been willing to work for Trump.  Shortly after McGahn started at Jones Day he picked up a new client: Aaron Schock, the congressman who was reeling from a scandal involving the misuse of federal funds and has since left office. To this day, according to FEC reports, Schock has still not paid Jones Day the nearly $750, 000 he owes them. (Jones Day representatives also did not return calls.) Getting stiffed by Schock put McGahn in a difficult position with his new law partners, said a Republican strategist who has worked with him. “He had this huge hole to fill. And when Trump came along, he was under a lot of pressure by management to fill that hole. ” So far, according to FEC reports, Trump has filled nearly $700, 000 of that hole. McGahn mostly has stayed behind the scenes since the New Hampshire rally, but his name has continued to pop up. He organized a meeting between Trump and members of Congress and accompanied the candidate to a recent meeting with the Republican National Committee. He’ll be there to help navigate the labyrinthine delegate and convention rules as the nomination fight enters the home stretch. And if Trump ever does decide to lean on outside money, he couldn’t have picked a better lawyer to have in his corner. “It’s crucial to know all the rules and the laws, so you don’t get screwed,” said Barry Bennett, a senior strategist for Trump who touches base with McGahn several times a week. “No one knows the rules better than Don McGahn, since he wrote most of them. ”  For a while, McGahn’s colleagues at Jones Day either didn’t know the firm was representing Trump or didn’t mind. That changed late last month when McGahn organized a meeting between the candidate and more than a dozen lawmakers at the firm’s Washington office. Many current employees just about lost their minds, according to David Lat, a former federal prosecutor who runs the blog Above the Law and closely monitors the chatter within the nation’s   legal shops. Last month Lat quoted a number of his Jones Day sources, anonymously, saying that they were deeply embarrassed by the Trump affiliation.  But wait a minute. There are lawyers out there representing perverts, hucksters and  . Is working for Trump really that much worse?  In a sense, says Lat, it could be.  “To represent someone in a campaign is almost like being a consigliere to a crime family: You are   and working to advance the mission,” explained Lat. “It’s not like representing someone in court against some kind of attack. It’s essentially like being an aide to the message. ” And Trump’s message is a tough one for folks at Jones Day to swallow. The firm favors Republican clients, but its sensibility is moderate. It has many clients in Latin America, where Trump’s inflammatory talk on immigration does not play well. Megyn Kelly, the    News host whom Trump has repeatedly attacked, is one of the firm’s notable alumni. Then there’s Benjamin Ginsberg, the preeminent election lawyer in the country and McGahn’s mentor and Jones Day  . Ginsberg, who made his name in 2000 arguing the Republican side in Bush v. Gore, started the election cycle working for Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker. He now spends much of his time on MSNBC helping explain delegate counts and convention scenarios to a bewildered electorate. So, Mr. Ginsberg  —   Is it ethical to go on television and discuss the 2016 election while the GOP   shovels money into your firm’s coffers? When you outline the convention strategies other candidates might take to wrestle the nomination from Trump, do you not worry about offending your own firm’s billionaire client?  Nope, says Ginsberg: That’s just not how big law firms work. “We work together, but we also have walls,” he said, and Jones Day has built “a big, beautiful wall” for the presidential election.  It’s hard to say whether this explanation will satisfy anyone. These days, many members of the Republican establishment say there’s a special place for Republicans who work for Trump.  “I think that anybody that is enabling or contemplating Donald Trump represents a betrayal of Republican principles,” said Juleanna Glover, who has worked for Jeb Bush and Jon Huntsman. Even fellow election lawyers admit that picking up a client constitutes some kind of endorsement: “I would never work for a candidate I don’t believe would make a good president,” said Trevor Potter, who served as Sen. John McCain’s campaign counsel. But don’t bet on McGahn getting blacklisted anytime soon, by the establishment or anyone else. Memories are short, and election lawyers are forever. Or, as Ryan Williams, a former Mitt Romney staffer put it: “They’re like accountants or undertakers. There’s always a demand for their profession. ” ",0,0,0,0,0,0,74

[Abdulrahman   the former    of the influential Asharq al Awsat newspaper and the Al Arabiya news network as well as a close associate of the Saudi royal family, wrote that Obama’s visit and participation in a summit of the Gulf States Council were the most significant gestures he has made since the signing of the nuclear deal with Iran last year, but moves that left much to be desired.  “Since the signing of the deal, little has changed in the field of the United States’ dialogue with the Gulf States on   issues, mainly the Syrian, Iraqi and Yemeni conflicts,” he wrote. “Since the signing of the deal with Iran, the White House failed to give the other camp security guarantees that would alleviate the dangers that the deal ushered in,” he added. “Meanwhile, Iran has pursued its efforts to take over the region. ” The regional conflicts have prevented the Gulf States from cooperating with Washington’s conciliatory approach to Iran “because it encouraged Iran’s Revolutionary Guards to intervene in international conflicts in an unprecedented manner. ”   wrote that after last year’s Camp David summit, in which Obama sought to allay the Sunni regimes’ fears on the eve of the Iran deal, “we expected the United States to offset the lifting of the sanctions with less tolerance towards Iran’s expansionist tendencies and its threats to its neighbors. ” He added that the Gulf States’ opposition to the deal didn’t stem from their opposition to Iran’s détente with the West, but “to the centerpiece of Iran’s foreign policy since 1979’s Islamic Revolution, which is to propagate anarchy and revolution. ” “It is inconceivable that the United States would open up to Iran and at the same time allow them to threaten the interests of other countries in the region, and demand that they be generous with them to boot,” he wrote, adding that American moves that would satisfy the Saudis include “following up on his public declarations to do away with Assad’s regime and implement the UN Security Council resolutions on Yemen. ”   concluded by saying that he is not optimistic. “Whatever Obama says, he is clearly not interested in a special alliance with the Gulf States and doesn’t see them as allies,” he wrote. “Obama’s   approach has failed  —   it led to anarchy and to the rise of   and the Islamic State. The solution is to increase the pressure on Iran and use it to put an end to the crises in Syria, Iraq, Yemen and Lebanon. ”",0,0,0,0,0,0,75
76,76,19361,19363,38106,"Politico Mag: Trade Will Give Trump Ohio, Wisconsin, Michigan",Breitbart,Julia Hahn,2016-05-30,2016.0,5.0,,"A Friday piece in Politico Magazine warns that a Hillary Clinton “fumble on trade” could give Donald Trump wins in Ohio, Wisconsin, and Michigan in a general election contest. [In a piece entitled, “How Hillary Loses,” David S. Bernstein writes that the new polls showing Trump ahead of Clinton represent a “terrifying moment for Democrats. ”  While Bernstein says one should not read too much into the early polls, he argues that the polling numbers reveal that “there is now a clear path for her to lose” the election. In particular, Bernstein explains that trade could win Trump Ohio, Wisconsin, and maybe Michigan. Bernstein’s warning in Politico echoes earlier concerns published by the liberal,   Huffington Post, which similarly outlined how Trump’s position on trade could deliver him to victory against Clinton. Bernstein writes: As soon as the votes were tallied in 2012, Richard Trumka of the   and Mary Kay Henry of SEIU were claiming unions had delivered Obama’s victory. They argued, with justification, that Ohio, Wisconsin and Nevada got into the blue column because of a massive turnout effort from labor. But earlier this year, both Trumka and Henry expressed concerns that Trump could flip that script. “Our members are responding to Trump’s message,” Henry said in one interview. “Donald Trump is tapping into the very real and very understandable anger of working people,” Trumka said in a speech. It’s not just that these workers are drawn to the raw emotion of Trump’s “you’ve been screwed” rhetoric. Polls show that union households tend to oppose free trade quite strongly. Sanders has made free trade a centerpiece of his primary campaign against Clinton. Trump, hoping to woo Sanders voters, frequently praises his position on that issue. Union voters largely agree with Trump that trade deals —  including those negotiated by Democratic Presidents Obama and Bill Clinton —  have taken their jobs away. Hillary Clinton has yet to counter this attack in any meaningful way. Her history on trade has been careful and political, which has left her struggling to articulate a strong argument against Sanders, let alone Trump. While the Politico piece is overly generous on Clinton’s record on trade, a more careful review of Clinton’s record shows that not only has she been hesitant to protect American workers, but she has reflexively supported a trade agenda that would send the jobs of American workers overseas. Indeed, in recent weeks Trump has hammered Bill Clinton for signing NAFTA and negotiating China’s entrance into the World Trade Organization (WTO). The United States lost   of its manufacturing jobs in the   era —   i. e. the years following NAFTA’s enactment and China’s subsequent entrance in the World Trade Organization in 2001. Hillary Clinton was an early proponent of NAFTA. Hillary Clinton also aggressively promoted the U. S. trade pact with South Korea, which was fraudulently billed to the American people as a deal which would dramatically boost American exports to South Korea. However, in the three years following the deal’s enactment, our trade deficit with South Korea had nearly doubled as U. S. exports to South Korea barely budged, while imports had exploded. According to the Economic Policy Institute, in the three years following the deal’s enactment, the growing goods trade deficits with Korea eliminated more than 75, 000 jobs. Clinton also supported the Colombian free trade agreement. In his book Clinton Cash, Peter Schweizer follows the trail of money and exposes Clinton’s ties to a major Clinton Foundation donor who supported the trade pact. Most notably, Clinton played a major role in promoting the   Partnership (TPP). In 2012, Clinton said that TPP “set the gold standard in trade agreements” —  a declaration that her opponent Bernie Sanders frequently highlights to Democratic primary voters. In 2012, Clinton told the Chamber of Commerce that she was “hoping we can finalize the [TPP] agreement this year   …     and then watch it take off. ” Clinton’s decision to promote the TPP demonstrates her underlying support for the international structures that underpin trade globalism. In other words, a politician can look at the text of the final product of a trade deal and say that she would like to see tweaks to certain provisions of the deal however, someone who fundamentally opposes the idea of binding the nation to an international commission would not be able to support the TPP in any form —  a point that was raised by Sen. Sessions in his 2016 candidates questionnaire, which received response from only one presidential candidate. Clinton’s aggressive boosting of the TPP illustrates her support for international governing structures, in which foreign countries are given equal weight to determining aspects of U. S. economic policy and decision making. As Sessions has pointed out, under the global governing commission established by the TPP —  which Sessions describes as a “Pacific Union” akin to the European Union —   “the Sultan of Brunei would have an equal vote to that of the United States. ” Bernstein continues to explain how   voters’ opposition to Clinton’s trade agenda could hurt her in the general election: It’s not hard to see how quickly this could start costing her Electoral College votes in the Rust Belt, where Trump hopes to improve on past Republican performance.   …     In Ohio, for example, 22 percent of 2012 voters came from union households, and 60 percent of them voted for Obama. In Wisconsin, a similar share of the electorate voted    for Obama over Romney. In 2016, both states went for Sanders over Clinton in their primaries. In Pennsylvania, where Trump is planning a major effort, union households provided Obama more than half his net margin. Yet beyond just union voters, polling data suggests that this issue will win Trump support amongst broad swaths of the American electorate —  as he saw during the Republican primary. Indeed, as Breitbart News reported two weeks prior to Indiana’s primary contest in which Trump knocked out his remaining Republican primary opponents, trade was a central issue to that race. Polling data shows that Republican voters are the group most skeptical of trade globalism —  a fact that has gone unrecognized by Party leaders, as well as professional Republicans in the #NeverTrump movement. Pew found that only a vanishing 11 percent of Republican voters believe that   “ ” will raise wages. By a nearly    margin, Republican voters believe that   “free trade” depresses wages, rather than increases wages, and by a greater than    margin, Republican voters believe that “free trade” will kill jobs, not create them. Yet despite polling data, Republican Party leaders worked tirelessly to give President Obama expanded trade powers. In fact, last year, Paul Ryan   an   with Sen. Ted Cruz promoting both fast track executive authority and the TPP. Moreover, GOP Party leaders continue to oppose Trump’s trade platform. As The Washington Post has reported, Paul Ryan has indicated he will not include Trump’s trade platform in the House GOP’s 2017 policy agenda. The House Speaker, whose views on foreign trade and foreign migration more closely resemble Clinton’s than Trump’s, has yet to endorse the presumptive GOP nominee. Similarly, some of the most prominent members of the #NeverTrump movement —  such as Jamie Weinstein and Mark Levin —  argue that Trump’s plan to reach out to   voters on trade will doom conservatism and the nation. In a recent piece, Levin worried aloud about Trump’s efforts to reach out to disaffected Democrats. Interestingly, Democrats have echoed Levin’s fears they are concerned that Trump’s nationalist position on trade will appeal to the   voters with whom Romney and Ryan were never able to connect.",0,0,0,0,0,0,76

","Could Republicans lose their majority in the House of Representatives come November? What was once unthinkable doesn’t seem so unthinkable anymore. Earlier this month, the nonpartisan Cook Political Report shifted their forecasts of ten House races in the Democrats’ direction. For now, the National Republican Congressional Committee doesn’t think that a media environment dominated by a nasty fight about the candidates’ wives, a battery charge against Trump’s campaign manager, and an endless stream of outrageous provocation is likely to hurt the average Republican House member. “Cable news networks might not cover the ins and outs of local members of Congress, but when our voters wake up in the morning and read their local paper they are seeing our Republican incumbents getting the job done for them,” says Katie Martin, communications director for the NRCC. In other words, stories in the local news about an incumbent’s work in the district will ultimately outweigh any misgivings about the man atop the presidential ticket. Share article on FacebookshareTweet The NRCC argues that even in a bad environment for Republicans, there’s no realistic way for Democrats to win the 30 seats they would need to retake control of the House. But that doesn’t mean that incumbent House Republicans couldn’t face a rough year. “A far more plausible scenario, assuming the GOP presidential ticket is weak, would be a loss of a dozen or more seats for Republicans, cutting their House margin in half,” writes Charlie Cook, Wasserman’s boss. He adds that at least twice as many Republicans as usual could defect to the Democratic presidential candidate if Donald Trump is the GOP nominee, “and just as important, Republican turnout could plummet, drowning   Republicans along with the top of the ticket. ” Already, some House Republicans in swing districts have made moves to distance themselves from Trump. Representative Barbara Comstock, who represents a suburban district in Northern Virginia, took $3, 000 that Trump had previously given to her campaign and donated the money to local centers for wounded veterans. She told the Winchester Star that Trump is not a good role model and “doesn’t represent” the Republican party. Representative Bob Dold, who represents the northern suburbs of Chicago in Illinois, has already announced he will not support Trump in November, adding, “Trump’s disgusting and offensive comments toward Hispanics, veterans, women, Muslims  —   the list goes on  —   disqualify him from holding the office of president of the United States. ” More 2016 It’s Time to Move On from the 2016 ElectionHillary Blames America FirstHillary Says Voter Suppression Cost Her the ElectionRepresentative Carlos Curbelo, who represents the southern tip of Florida and Key West, said he hoped that Trump would be defeated in the primaries but refused to rule out voting for Clinton if no   conservative candidate emerges. There have been recent presidential elections with significant shifts in the House (2008, when Democrats picked up 21 seats) and ones that barely altered the lower chamber’s balance of power at all (2004, when Republicans picked up three seats, and 2012, when Democrats picked up eight). But Republicans have never before run with a presidential nominee who is perceived unfavorably by 63 percent of poll respondents.

","Having long been playing defense on Obamacare because he expanded Medicaid in his state, Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R) went on the offensive Wednesday and attacked Republicans for promising in the 2014 election cycle that they would repeal Obamacare. “You’ve been supporting conservative candidates,” Kasich said on an appearance on Jay Weber’s Wisconsin radio show, by way of BuzzFeed. “They told you in 2014 they were gonna repeal Obamacare. Do you realize, that’s just —  that’s a big joke?” Kasich also called the 2014 repeal vow ”a stupid promise,” since President Obama would have still been in the White House. ”We’ve got all these conservatives all stirred up and angry because they didn’t keep their word,” he said. Kasich has been pounded throughout the Republican primary for his decision to expand Medicaid in Ohio.

The move, which was requested by Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder, means FEMA is authorized to provide equipment and resources to the people affected. Federal funding will help cover the cost of providing water, water filters and other items. A state of emergency has been declared by Flint’s own mayor since  . Pediatrician Dr. Mona   who called attention to the elevated lead levels in Flint’s children, explained to NPR’s Michel Martin last month how the city’s water came to be contaminated: ”The city of Flint under   emergency management, almost bankrupt . .. switched their water source from Detroit, which was fresh Great Lakes water source, which we’ve been using for over 50 years, to the local Flint River to save money. ”And that local Flint River was innately more corrosive than the Great Lakes water source. And the critical corrosion inhibitor, which is mandatory for all drinking water systems to use . .. was not added to that water. ”So you had a more corrosive water source without the corrosion control added to it, going into an aging infrastructure with a lot of lead plumbing. That was a perfect storm for that lead to leach out of the pipes into the drinking water and into the bodies of children.” The switch began nearly two years ago, and Flint has since switched back to Detroit’s water supply. But the damage to the pipes has already been done, and the leaching of lead into tap water continues. The question of who knew about the danger  —   and when  —   has led to a political crisis in Flint, with protesters calling for the governor’s resignation. Concerns over Flint’s water were raised months before the state called a state of emergency or provided bottled water. ”Critics say the state’s response  —   in particular, the governor’s handling of the crisis  —   has been inadequate at best, criminal at worst,” Michigan Radio’s Steve Carmody reported for NPR earlier this week. ”Flint’s mayor estimates the cost of fixing the city’s water infrastructure at more than a billion dollars. There’s no estimate on the cost of the   health effects on Flint residents who drank   water for more than a year.”",0,0,0,0,0,0,80

Lewandowski met with Trump’s    Jared Kushner on Monday to discuss possible roles in the administration, according to Politico, but was not offered the job he sought of senior adviser to the president.  “I will always be   Trump’s biggest supporter,” Lewandowski said in a statement on Wednesday announcing the firm. “After considering multiple opportunities within the administration, I informed him and his team I think I can best help him outside the formal structure of the government. I very much look forward to doing that every day. ” Lewandowski was a polarizing force while serving as Trump’s first campaign manager. He was charged in May with battery for grabbing the arm of reporter Michelle Fields and pulling her back as she tried to ask Trump a question. The incident was captured on camera, countering Lewandowski’s claims that he did not lay a hand on Fields, then a reporter for Breitbart News. Lewandowski was subsequently hired as a contributor on CNN, a move that raised questions due to his proximity to Trump.  Although he had been ousted as campaign manager, Lewandowski continued to travel with Trump on occasion and attend his rallies. Lewandowski also remained on Trump’s payroll, which both the campaign and CNN characterized as severance payments but were dubbed as “strategy consulting” in official filings with the Federal Election Commission. Lewandowski framed his strategy for Trump while on the campaign as letting “Trump be Trump” which helped him curry favor with the real estate mogul and earn his trust. But Lewandowski’s relationship was more fraught with members of Trump’s family, particularly his children, and his behavior was described by insiders as volatile.  Lewandowski said his new firm will ensure that outside groups remain organized as Trump takes office on 20 January. Trump routinely campaigned on “draining the swamp” which his team has said extends to traditional Washington consultants, even as the   has filled his prospective cabinet with political insiders. “My goal is to make sure the priorities of the Trump administration become reality,” Lewandowski said. Former House speaker Newt Gingrich, a longtime supporter of Trump and former surrogate, suggested on Wednesday that the   “now just disclaims” his vow to drain the swamp. “He now says it was cute, but he doesn’t want to use it any more,” Gingrich said in an interview with NPR. Although Trump, as a candidate, called for reducing the influence of lobbyists and consultants in Washington, several of those poised to work in his administration are former lobbyists and top donors to his campaign.",0,0,0,0,0,0,81
82,82,36872,37896,56737,Secret Service spoke to Trump campaign about 2nd Amendment comment,CNN,Jim Sciutto,2016-08-10,2016.0,8.0,," (CNN) A US Secret Service official confirms to CNN that the USSS has spoken to the Trump campaign regarding his Second Amendment comments.  ”There has been more than one conversation” on the topic, the official told CNN. But it’s unclear at what level in the campaign structure the conversations occurred. The campaign told the USSS that Donald Trump did not intend to incite violence, according to the official.  ”No such meeting or conversation ever happened,” Trump tweeted in response to CNN’s report. Gun rights, The controversy erupted on Tuesday afternoon when Trump said at a rally that Second Amendment defenders might be able to stop Clinton from appointing justices to the Supreme Court who could weaken gun rights. ”Hillary wants to abolish    essentially abolish the Second Amendment. By the way, if she gets to pick, if she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do, folks. Although the Second Amendment people, maybe there is, I don’t know,” Trump said. ”But I tell you what, that will be a horrible day, if Hillary gets to put her judges in, right now we’re tied.” The Secret Service’s communications director Cathy Milhoan has not confirmed the conversations between the campaign and the Secret Service, but said in a statement Tuesday that ”the U. S. Secret Service is aware of Mr. Trump’s comments.” Trump said Tuesday evening that he was simply trying to unify gun owners against Clinton in the voting booth. Read: NRA spends $3 million on new   ad, ”This is a political movement. This is a strong political movement, the Second Amendment,” Trump said to Fox News’ Sean Hannity. ”And there can be no other interpretation . .. I mean, give me a break.” Clinton responded Wednesday to Trump’s suggestion at an Iowa rally, saying, ”words matter.” ”Words matter my friends, and if you are running to be president or you are president of the United States, words can have tremendous consequences,” Clinton said. ”Yesterday we witnessed the latest in a long line of casual comments from Donald Trump that cross the line.” Supporters downplay remarks, The Republican presidential nominee’s supporters Wednesday attempted to quell the controversy, saying either that Trump was joking or that Democrats and the media were spinning it into something bigger than it was. Many interpreted Trump’s comments as a threat to rival Hillary Clinton. Corey Lewandowski, Trump’s former campaign manager, said the billionaire businessman was trying to unite Second Amendment supporters to turn out to defeat Clinton. ”This was a joke . .. He wasn’t inciting violence,” Lewandowski told Chris Cuomo on CNN’s New Day.    York Mayor Rudy Giuliani said Wednesday that the Clinton campaign and the press were misconstruing Trump’s words. ”What he intended is very, very simple    that (gun owners) should vote against her,” Giuliani said on ABC’s Good Morning America. ”He had no idea that anybody would interpret his words that way. It was so obvious to all of us what he meant.” Read: Donald Trump: ’Second Amendment’ gun advocates could deal with Hillary Clinton, Maine Sen. Susan Collins, who said she won’t vote for either party’s candidate, said on CNN’s ”New Day” Wednesday that she did not think Trump was inciting violence, but that he has only himself to blame for people leaping to that conclusion because of his consistent ”stream of inappropriate and reckless comments.” Clinton supports slam comments, But Clinton supporters continued to slam Trump on Wednesday, saying that violence is never a joking matter. ”Words matter, particularly from those folks who want to be president of the United States,” Clinton surrogate Christine Quinn, a former New York City Council speaker, said on ”New Day.” ”To think that joking about any kind of violence could be funny . .. simply reflects a disregard for the impact of violence.” Read: New York Daily News calls for Donald Trump to end his presidential campaign, Former Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm agreed, telling Cuomo that joking about assassinating a candidate is not presidential. ”It is, in fact, dangerous for the country,” she said. Bernice King, the daughter of civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. took to Twitter to voice her concerns. ”As the daughter of a leader who was assassinated, I find #Trump’s comments distasteful, disturbing, dangerous,” she tweeted. And former CBS Evening News anchor Dan Rather posted on Facebook that Trump ”crossed a line with dangerous potential.” ”By any objective analysis, this is a new low and unprecedented in the history of American presidential politics,” he wrote. ”This is no longer about policy, civility, decency or even temperament. This is a direct threat of violence against a political rival. It is not just against the norms of American politics, it raises a serious question of whether it is against the law.” Read: Dan Rather calls Trump’s ’Second Amendment people’ comments a ’new low’ Green Party candidate Jill Stein also weighed in, calling for Trump to be disarmed. And the daughter of Sandy Hook School Principal Dawn Hochsprung, who died in the school shooting there along with 20 children and five other staffers, sent a message to Trump via Twitter. Meanwhile, the Clinton campaign is using Trump’s words to fundraise, sending out his comments in an email to supporters Wednesday morning.",0,0,0,0,0,0,82

84,84,42119,95578,141380,Donald Trump is the punk-rock president America deserves,New York Post,Kyle Smith,2016-11-09,2016.0,11.0,http://nypost.com/2016/11/09/donald-trump-is-the-punk-rock-president-america-deserves/,"Donald Trump may favor stodgy blue suits and boring red ties and wear his hair in a strange double combover, but don’t be fooled. That’s how he looks, not who he is. Who he is is a guy with a safety pin through his nose and a purple mohawk. He just pulled off the most punk act in American history. If you’re a Hillary Clinton voter, or a member of the average media outlet, observing the Trump phenomenon to you was like watching Frank Sinatra in the 1970s:     going through the motions appealing to a rapidly disappearing demographic, relying entirely on crusty oldies like “My Way. ” Yet the version of “My Way” Trump actually represented was the one gargled by Sid Vicious, the   Sex Pistol, over the closing credits of “Goodfellas”  —   crude, sneering, shocking, postmodern. None of us could believe what Trump was doing  —   because no one had ever seen anyone do it that way before.  in The Post on May 30, 2015. (For that little flub, Trump rewarded me with a mention in his most recent book, sarcastically dubbing me The Post’s “resident genius. ”) I could not decipher Trump. Who could? He was inventing a new language of politics on the fly. He was operating at another level. Every Republican  —   including, as recently as 2012, Trump!  —   said a Republican could not get elected president without making inroads among Latino voters. And Latino voters, everyone believed, really did not want to hear about crackdowns on illegal immigrants. So Trump said he was going to crack down on illegal immigrants. “When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best,” he said in his freewheeling campaign kickoff speech. “They’re not sending you; they’re not sending you. They’re sending people that have lots of problems, and they’re bringing those problems with us. They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists, and some, I assume, are good people. ” Only “some” Mexican immigrants are good people? It’s like when a punk singer spits on his audience. According to exit polls last night, Trump actually did slightly better than Mitt Romney among Latinos  —   29 percent against Mitt’s 27 percent. Remember when somebody mentioned the sainted war hero John McCain and Trump wisecracked that he couldn’t be that much of a hero if he got caught? Punk! Remember when he promised a big announcement that he was ready to concede that President Obama was actually born in the United States and every news hound covered it as if it were the Super Bowl? He turned it into an infomercial for his new Trump hotel in the Old Post Office building on Pennsylvania Avenue in DC. Hey, what’s more punk than shameless love of filthy lucre? Remember when Hillary Clinton, Lisa   was busily organizing a landslide? She did everything by the book. She amassed a prim little army of   covering her bases by opening proper little field offices in every burg in America, even in Dallas and Houston. Trump scoffed, and sent out some 3 a. m. tweets. (Hillary, we learned from WikiLeaks, once needed 12 staffers and 12 hours of deliberation to craft a single tweet.) Even Trump himself often seemed so ambivalent about the position he found himself in that the most seasoned political reporters openly wondered if he even wanted to win. Just not giving a flying fig is the quintessence of punk. Trump didn’t just throw out the playbook, he set fire to it. And America loved it. Not releasing his taxes? Fine, said America  —   can you help us game the system too? So antagonizing the media that major news outlets dropped all pretense of neutrality and openly campaigned against him? Not a problem, said America  —   we hate those sons of bitches too, and the enemy of our enemy is our friend. Punk is the art of taking the stage with no preparation whatsoever and screaming: It’s me against the world, and what the freak are you gonna do about it? The last     it was Trump against the world, and the world lost.        ",0,0,0,0,0,0,84

Kelly Ayotte said during a debate on Monday that she would ”absolutely” point to Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump as a role model for a child. She issued a statement after the debate saying she ”misspoke.” The   senator was asked by a moderator during the NECN debate: ”Would you tell them to be like Donald Trump? Would you point to him as a role model?”  ”I think that certainly there are many role models that we have, and I believe he can serve as president and so, absolutely. I would do that,” she said at the New England College hosted debate in Henniker, New Hampshire. In a statement afterward, Ayotte said: ”I misspoke tonight. While I would hope all of our children would aspire to be president, neither Donald Trump nor Hillary Clinton have set a good example and I wouldn’t hold either of them as role models for my kids.” Ayotte is currently locked in a hotly contested Senate reelection race against Democratic rival, Gov. Maggie Hassan. Ayotte has said she is voting for Trump, but not endorsed him for president. Ayotte has said that she will she will ”stand up” to Trump if he becomes president    but she will vote for him in November.  ”I will take on my own party,” Ayotte told CNN in Nashua in August. ”I really believe that this is a big issue in this race    that I am the one candidate that will stand up to whomever is in the White House to do good things when we can work together    also when it’s wrong to stand up to them.” During Monday’s debate, someone   asked Ayotte: ”If you think he can serve as president, why won’t you endorse him?”  ”Because I’ve had some disagreements with him,” she said. ”And I’ve been quite clear about those disagreements. And this is an area where Gov. Hassan has been lockstep with Secretary Clinton. I haven’t heard major disagreements that she’s had with Secretary Clinton so who’s going to step up for the people of New Hampshire?”  Since Trump launched his campaign last summer, he called some Mexicans ”rapists” during his announcement speech, said Sen. John McCain isn’t a ”war hero” because he was captured, proposed a temporary Muslim ban, mocked a disabled reporter during a campaign rally, repeatedly made harsh comments about women, and attacked the Khans, a Gold Star family, for their comments at the Democratic National Convention. And at a rally in Pennsylvania this weekend, Trump hit Clinton on her ”stamina,” said that Clinton is not ”loyal” to her husband, former President Bill Clinton, and called her an ”incompetent” and ”sarcastic woman.”  In the past, Ayotte has been heavily critical on Trump’s controversies, including his attacks against the Khan family.  When Trump was asked about Ayotte in an August Washington Post interview, he criticized her lack of support and implied she was weak. ”You have a Kelly Ayotte, who doesn’t want to talk about Trump, but I’m beating her in the polls by a lot. You tell me. Are these people that should be representing us?” he said. ”We need loyal people in this country. We need fighters in this country. We don’t need weak people. We have enough of them.”",0,0,0,0,0,0,85

It’s an aspirational blueprint that details how he would set priorities if he controlled the government’s checkbook . .. which he doesn’t. ”This budget is not about looking back at the road we have traveled,” Obama said. ”It is about looking forward.” But congressional Republicans are looking past the president. House Speaker Paul Ryan dismissed the budget as ”a progressive manual for growing the federal government at the expense of hardworking Americans.” Here are five big things you need to know about Obama’s eighth budget blueprint. 1. It’s his last . .. and least influential, The president’s budget is invariably described as ”dead on arrival” when it reaches Capitol Hill. This one got that label weeks earlier. Republican leaders of the House and Senate Budget Committees don’t even plan to hold a token hearing on the $4 trillion White House spending plan. Obama will be out of office less than four months into the budget year. And the   of the budget itself is overshadowed by the New Hampshire primary. 2. More red ink, President Obama boasted in his State of the Union address of cutting the deficit as a share of the economy by   during his time in office. This year, however, the deficit is creeping up again  —   largely as a result of tax breaks extended by Congress at the end of 2015. The president’s budget projects that deficits will remain in a manageable range  —   less than 3 percent of GDP  —   for the next decade. That includes some rosy assumptions, though, about tax revenues, health care savings and immigration reform. 3. Domestic shots across the bow, The president’s budget includes a variety of proposals designed to provoke a debate with Republicans. On the revenue side, these include a new $  tax on crude oil which would add up to 24 cents a gallon to the price of gasoline, higher taxes on capital gains, and a renewed push to close what the White House calls the ”trust fund loophole.” On the spending side, the president has proposed more investments in clean energy, mass transit, summertime meal subsidies for poor children, and expanded unemployment insurance. 4. Security spending, on the ground and online, Obama is seeking $11 billion for the battle against ISIS, $3. 4 billion to shore up European defenses and discourage Russian aggression, and $19 billion to enhance the nation’s cybersecurity. 5. A few nods to bipartisanship, While the overall budget is going nowhere, a few of its more modest ideas may have legs. The White House notes there’s bipartisan support for accelerating cancer research, offering more treatment to people addicted to heroin and prescription pain medication, and expanding a tax credit to help   workers who don’t have children.",0,0,0,0,0,0,86
87,87,37806,141268,212018,Donald Trump’s ‘John Miller’ interview is even crazier than you think,Washington Post,Chris Cillizza,2016-05-16,2016.0,5.0,"https://web.archive.org/web/20160517003626/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/05/16/donald-trumps-john-miller-interview-is-even-crazier-than-you-think/
","       During the 1980s, Donald Trump was known to return reporters’ phone calls posing as a fictional spokesman for the Trump organization. The name Trump assumed varied slightly  —   ”John Miller,” John Barron,” and ”John Baron”  —   but the goal didn’t: Tout Trump as a   brilliant playboy. The Post got hold of one conversation between ”Miller” and a reporter named Sue Carswell from 1991. The transcript is below, and it is amazing. Using Genius, I annotated it. You can too! Sign up for Genius and annotate alongside me! To see an annotation, click or tap the highlighted part of the transcript.  John Miller: How are you? Interviewer [Female]: Good. How are you? What’s your name again? John Miller: John Miller. Interviewer: And you work with [indiscernible]? John Miller: Yes, that’s correct. Interviewer: John Miller. Can you sort of  —   I guess we’re going to try and put a story together, and we have a deadline of today because our magazine closed, well, basically yesterday, but we’ll probably get something together  —   you know, it’s been on the cover both here and the Post. John Miller: Yeah, I saw that. Interviewer: What kind of comment is coming from, you know, your agency or from Donald? John Miller: Well, it just that he really decided that he wasn’t, you know, he didn’t want to make any commitment. He didn’t want to make a commitment. He really thought it was too soon. He’s coming out of a marriage, and he’s starting to do tremendously well financially. As you saw, he got his licenses five to nothing the other day and totally unanimous. And he’s really been working hard and doing well. And probably, as you know, there’s a real estate depression in the United States and he’s probably doing as well as anybody there is. And frankly, he wants to keep it that way. And he just thought it was too soon to make any commitment to anybody. Interviewer: So what is going to happen when  —   is she being asked to leave or is she going to be allowed to stay? John Miller: Well, he treats everybody well. You know, you don’t know him, but he’s a  —   Interviewer: No, I have met him. John Miller: Have you met him? He’s a good guy and he’s not going to hurt anybody. The one article said he was going to throw her out of the apartment is total nonsense. He is going to always treat her well as he treated his wife well. I mean, he paid his wife a great deal of money. He did it in a very bad period of time and, ultimately, that was settled. There were those that say that that was even put that way. I don’t know if you heard that but that Trump became poor until he got his divorce. And then all of a sudden, he’s been doing very well, and I guess you probably heard that, too. But he treated his wife well and he treated  —   and he will treat Marla well. He’s somebody that has a lot of options, and, frankly, he gets called by everybody. He gets called by everybody in the book, in terms of women. Interviewer: Like who? John Miller: Well, he gets called by a lot of people. Interviewer: Yeah. Well, what about  —   this Carla Bruni, I mean, how important is she right now? Is she [ ]? John Miller: I think it’s somebody that  —   you know, she’s beautiful. I saw her once quickly and she’s beautiful and all, but I think that he’s got a whole open field really. A lot of the people that you write about, and you people do a great job, by the way, but a lot of the people that you write about really are  —   I mean, they call. They just call. Actresses, people that you write about just call to see if they can go out with him and things. Interviewer: You can’t say, like, did Madonna ever really call? John Miller: He was so set up with that. You know, Madonna called and what happened  —   I mean, I don’t know if you want to listen to this. Interviewer: No, I do. John Miller: Do you? Do you have a second? Interviewer: Yeah, obviously. John Miller: What happened is it was a benefit at the Plaza Hotel which he owned for Vreeland, Diana Vrelland, or no, for Martha Graham. It was a ball benefit for Martha actually just before she passed away. And Madonna was there and she came in a beautiful evening gown and combat boots. She was wearing combat boots, and Trump was asked to go over to meet her. And he was there just for a little while to say hello and to make a speech and make like an introductory speech. Madonna was in the room, and so somebody from Madonna’s entourage, because she comes in with an entourage of dancers and everything else, and somebody from Madonna’s entourage came over and said, “Would you go over and say hello to Madonna?” And so he went over and said hello to Madonna and he gave his autograph to the dancers. She said, “These are fans” and all this. “Will you give them the autograph?” So he said, “Best wishes” or something. And then all of a sudden  —   and that was the end. And then he said goodbye to her and that was literally the end. He’s got zero interest in Madonna. It was literally the end. And the next day in the newspapers, they had a story that he wanted to go out with her and everything else. Besides that, that she was sitting there with her boyfriend. I think his name was Ward or something  —   Interviewer: Yeah, Tony Ward. John Miller:  —   and she was sitting there right with her boyfriend. So, I mean, it wouldn’t be appropriate. Then the next day, there was a story that Trump went to [inaudible] and Madonna was supposedly at [inaudible] and that was another total nonsense. So, somehow, there was a thing. And then she called recently about this fight and wanted to go out. You know, she’s got this PR machine that I guess you people play to very well but it really was nonsense. So, anyway. Interviewer: I don’t think we ever reported that about Madonna and Donald. John Miller: Well, she called and wanted to go out with him, that I can tell you. And one of the other people that you’re writing about  —   by the way, I’m sort of new here. Interviewer: What is your position there? John Miller: Well, I’m sort of handling PR because he gets so much of it. And frankly, I mean, I could tell you off the record. Until I get to know you, off the record, I can tell you that he didn’t care if he got bad PR until he got his divorce finished. So when he got a lot of bad financial stuff, he liked it because, you know, it was good because he could get a divorce finished. And once his divorce is finished, if you noticed since then he’s doing well financially and he’s doing well in every other way. The licensing was five to nothing. And people are saying how come all of a sudden he’s doing so well? And then I guess Newsday about two weeks ago did a story on that. So I’ve sort of been put in here to handle because I’ve never seen anybody get so many calls from the press. Interviewer: Where did you come from? John Miller: I basically worked for different firms. I worked for a couple of different firms, and I’m somebody that he knows and I think somebody that he trusts and likes. So I’m going to do this a little part time, and then, yeah, go on with my life, too. Interviewer: Is he trying to  —   I mean, is Marla trying to reconcile all this or is this  —   John Miller: Marla wants to be back with him, and he wants to be with her, but he just, he just feels it’s too soon. Interviewer: What about the ring? John Miller: Well, it was never an engagement ring, because that was my first question. It was never an engagement ring. It was a ring  —   I mean, he wouldn’t buy the engagement ring. Actually, he bought the ring at the Taj Mahal at Tiffany’s. The only place that Tiffany’s has that, you know, in a hotel is because of his relationship with Tiffany being the neighbor next door to Trump Tower and Tiffany decided to open up a store at the Taj Mahal. And this was a way of giving Tiffany some business in addition to getting Ivan  —   getting Marla something that would be nice. So he did that, and as I told him and other people told him, when you want to buy a present, don’t make it a ring the next time. It was a little confusing. Interviewer: Make it a chain. John Miller: Make it anything. Anything but a ring, I guess. Interviewer: Do you think there’s any fear that Marla will spill everything at all or  —   ? John Miller: It doesn’t matter to him. He truly doesn’t care. I’ve never seen somebody that’s so immune, that he gets immune to, you know, some people would say you got bad press three or four months ago. Now, he’s starting to get good press where I don’t know what you call this but this is a big press. But I’ve never seen somebody so immune to  —   he actually thrived on the bad press initially. And once the divorce was over, he said, “We have to change this” and it’s very interesting. Frankly, if he got good press during the divorce, he’d be in court right now because she settled because she thought that she better believe the press and she settled. And now, he’s doing great and now she would like not to settle. Ivana, when she didn’t settle, she made a huge mistake and she’s now had a huge fight with her lawyer, Michael Kennedy, over why they made the settlement. And it’s over. He sort of laughs at everything. Interviewer: How does Donald feel about Ivana’s [indiscernible] with Barbara Walters? John Miller: Well, it was a total violation of  —   I mean, I could tell you  —   Interviewer: Yeah. But then, that was  —   I mean, did the judge, Phyllis What’  ? John Miller:   yeah, but that’s going to be  —   the judge felt that when Donald got Ivana to sign that agreement, that Donald got Ivana to void her rights and that the judge was wrong because there’s so much case law on that. And what happened is the judge said  —   by the way, she can take that clause out. She just said she’s not going to hold Ivana in contempt. In other words, if somebody  —   if she violates and she’s not going to put Ivana in jail for violating. Okay? So she didn’t void that clause. Now, Donald’s got a decision as to whether or not he wants to pay her any more money because by violating that clause, he in theory doesn’t have to pay her any money. Interviewer: Being the good guy that he’s trying to be  —   I mean  —   John Miller: I’m not sure what he’s going to do. Again, you could say that she shouldn’t have done that either. I mean, you sign an agreement, you go through months and months, and she can’t say she didn’t know this one. And what he did was smart because he got not only Ivana to sign the agreement, but he got Ivana’s lawyers to sign the agreement that she’d do it, that she speaks English perfectly, that everything in the agreement is known and studied and everything else. So, in theory, I think he could probably  —   you know, I think that could have cost her many millions of dollars. I don’t know that he’s going to enforce it or not. Interviewer: What about that whole thing that was brought up in the news whether Marla wouldn’t sign any sort of prenuptial? Did that have anything to do with the ending of the relationship? John Miller: No, no. Interviewer: Was that true? I mean, was he trying to get her to sign anything? John Miller: Well, I can tell you this. Just off the record, there’s no way he gets married without a prenuptial agreement. You understand that. It was painful but worked in the Ivana case because, you know, while it was challenged, it still ended up being upheld and worked. And frankly, she got not exactly one penny, she didn’t get one penny more than what the agreement called for. So that’s that. And she spent a lot of money on lawyers and a lot of money on everything and that was the year of the circus, but they do stand up. I can tell you there was never any talk of marriage from Donald’s point of view. I can also say that Marla would’ve liked to get married, obviously, but it was just something he didn’t want to do. It’s just too soon. And, you know, hopefully, he’ll maintain a good relationship with Marla. [Indiscernible] but it’s just too soon. Interviewer: What about this Ivana thing? It says in the Newsday Trump also told friends that when he and Ivana met last week, she indicated that she would be interested in reconciliation? John Miller: Ivana wants to get back with Donald, but she  —   Interviewer: Really? After saying on Barbara Walters that she never would? John Miller: What is she going to say? What is she going to say? She’s going to say when he’s with somebody else and had other people lined up, is she going to say, “Yes, I want to get back. I want to get back. ” You know, she’s a pretty savvy woman and she’s not going to say  —   I mean, he’s living with Marla and he’s got three other girlfriends, and then, and she’s not going to say, I really want to get back, you know? She wants to get back, she’s told it to a lot of her friends and she’s told it to him, but it’s so highly unlikely. That’s off the record. He left. I mean, it was his choice to leave and he left. Interviewer: He left for Marla. John Miller: No, he didn’t leave, no. See, that’s the biggest misconception of this whole thing. The second question I asked about after the ring was the biggest misconception is he left. He didn’t leave for Marla. He really left for himself. He didn’t leave for Marla. He never left for Marla. He was going to leave anyway. Marla was there, but he was going to leave anyway. Whether there was a Marla or not he was going to leave anyway. So now he has somebody else named Carla who is beautiful and I guess you have something on her. I don’t know if you do or not. Interviewer: No, they won’t talk about her. He didn’t say anything about her. I mean, she’s a daughter of who  —   John Miller: Well, she’s a very successful model, etc. etc. But again, he didn’t leave Marla for her. He just wants [indiscernible] he does things for himself. He leaves for himself, he does things for himself. He, when he makes the decision, that will be a very lucky woman. But he’s not going to do that until he makes the decision. You know, when he makes the decision, he’s very capable of a total commitment when he makes the decision. But he felt it’s too soon. Off the record, he probably felt Marla wasn’t the right one, or whatever, but he just felt it was too soon. Interviewer: How did he meet Carla? John Miller: At the Plaza Hotel, she was doing a Carolina Herrera fashion show. Interviewer: Was Ivana there, do you think? Does she go to fashion shows? John Miller: Well she goes to them, but less so since, you know, since  —   Interviewer: When did he meet Carla there? John Miller: Probably a few months ago. Interviewer:  . Have they been able to see each other? John Miller: Well, not really. And again, I heard with Carla  —   I mean, I’ll give you  —   this is getting to be  —   this is a little different from what I normally discuss. This is I think an interesting point. Carla is a very beautiful girl from Italy whose father is one of the wealthiest men in Europe. Interviewer: Who is he? What’s the name of her father? John Miller: Her father’s name is  —   her name is Carla Bruni Tedeschi. Interviewer: How do you spell that? John Miller: I don’t know. She doesn’t use the last name because it’s too complicated, you know [indiscernible]. But anyway, but her father is one of the wealthiest men in Europe. Carla is extraordinarily beautiful and didn’t want to be a model except that every time she’d go to a show, [indiscernible] to look, Ralph Lauren and various people would say, Carla, you have to be on the show, etc. etc. So she does all of the top shows and she’s always very busy and very successful, etc. etc. She was having a big thing with Mick Jagger. Did you hear about this? Interviewer: Well, I’ve just been reading about it. John Miller: What happened is she was going with Eric Clapton. Interviewer: Mick Jagger, who was married at that point? John Miller: Mick Jagger, as of three months ago she was having a big thing. [indiscernible] What she  —   Just doesn’t want to be in the limelight. What she was having a very big thing with Mick Jagger. And then what happened, she was going with Eric Clapton, and Eric Clapton introduced her to Mick Jagger, and then Mick Jagger started calling her, and she ended up going with Mick Jagger. And then she dropped Mick Jagger for Donald, and that’s where it is right now. And again, he’s not making any commitments to Carla either just so you understand. Interviewer: What kinds of things have they done? I mean, do they go out? [Indiscernible] John Miller: Well, they just get along very good and she’s very pretty and all of that stuff. But, you know, he doesn’t have any idea who she is, right? When he meets the right woman, it’s going to be a great relationship and it’s going to be a very, you know, because he believes strongly in the marriage concept. In all fairness, he was married for 12 years and he was happily married for 12, you know, for many of those years, I guess, and he believes in it, especially in this society today, I can tell you. But he believes in it. Interviewer: Where is he living now? I mean is he  —   John Miller: He lives in Trump Tower. He has the apartment at the top of Trump Tower. Interviewer: Okay. And Ivana also has an apartment at Trump Tower? John Miller: She has an apartment at Trump Tower, but the court order is that she has to leave within a period of less than a year. Interviewer: Yeah.

88,88,45450,98909,146001,James Clapper says Watergate ’pales’ in comparison with Trump Russia scandal,Guardian,Katharine Murphy,2017-06-07,2017.0,6.0,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jun/07/james-clapper-says-watergate-pales-in-comparison-with-trump-and-russia-scandal,"The former US director of national intelligence James Clapper says events in Washington now are more serious than the Watergate scandal of the 1970s, and that it is imperative investigators get to the bottom of the Trump administration’s links with the Putin regime. Clapper used a speech to Australia’s National Press Club on Wednesday to launch a critique of the US president, Donald Trump, describing his decision to cultivate Russia and share intelligence with the Putin regime as “very problematic”. He described Trump’s firing of the FBI chief Jim Comey as “egregious and inexcusable”. The former intelligence director was asked how current events compared to Watergate and he said the behaviour under scrutiny now was more serious. “I think you compare the two, that Watergate pales, really, in my view, compared to what we’re confronting now. ” Clapper’s appearance in Canberra comes before highly anticipated testimony later this week by Comey before the Senate intelligence committee. The committee is examining whether Trump’s campaign colluded with Russian officials who interfered in the US presidential election. Comey is expected to face questions about whether Trump tried to persuade him to stop an investigation into improper contacts between one of his top backroom advisers and Russian officials, and whether the former FBI director was sacked by the president because he refused to comply. Clapper told the National Press Club in Canberra it was “absolutely crucial for the United States, and for that matter for the world, for this presidency, for the Republicans, for the Democrats and for our nation at large, that we get to the bottom of this”. “Is there a smoking gun with all the smoke? I don’t know the answer to that. I think it’s vital, though, we find that out. ” Clapper insisted that, whatever Trump’s intentions, there was no way the US and Russia could be allies, because Russia was “opposed to our democracy and values and see us, particularly the United States, as the cause of all their problems and frustrations”. He said he had a “real hard time reconciling the threat the Russians pose to the United States and, by extension, western democracies in general” with the solicitousness of the Trump administration towards Moscow. “The Russians are not our friends,” he said. Clapper said Trump, then   had remarked to him “during my one and only, first and last ever, I’m sure, sojourn to Trump Tower” that it would be “a good thing if we could get along with the Russians”. Clapper said he told Trump: “Sure, whenever our interests converge, and they do occasionally, fine, but as far as our being intimate allies, trusting buds, with the Russians? That is just not gonna happen”. He told the Canberra press club the two countries could not be allies because they had irreconcilable differences. It was in Russia’s “genes to be opposed, diametrically opposed, to the United States and western democracies”. Clapper said he had attempted in the middle of January to dissuade Trump, during a private phone conversation, from attacking the intelligence establishment in Washington but he said the intervention fell on deaf ears. The president’s team, he said, was motivated by “extreme paranoia” about any material that cast doubt on the legitimacy of Trump’s election. Clapper was asked how Australia should approach its most important foreign policy relationship given the challenges posed by the Trump administration. He said the question was somewhat “imponderable. ” He observed there were people in the administration who could be trusted  —   nominating Jim Mattis, the defence secretary, John Kelly, the homeland security chief, and HR McMaster, the national security adviser. “They have understanding and respect for our institutions,” he said. He said he was reluctant to give Australia public advice about its foreign policy relationships but he said: “I just think Australia has to keep on and make decisions based on Australia’s best national interests. “I have to say that I think prime minister Turnbull has found the balance between being very tactful with our president but at the same time not compromising Australia’s interests and its sovereignty. ” Clapper was asked whether Trump’s decision to share Israeli intelligence with Russia should prompt a rethink of intelligence sharing arrangements under the Five Eyes partnership. He said individual countries would have to make their own judgments. Clapper said that, at the institutional level, agencies would be concerned if intelligence sharing was discontinued. “But, to some extent, you know, it reaches a certain level where it’s out of our control,” Clapper said. “I hope it doesn’t happen but I could certainly understand if it did and that’s a judgment that each and every national government will have to make. ”",0,0,0,0,0,0,88

And that could be “the beginning of a longer turning inward that could end up making the world a far more dangerous place. ” The State Department has just   that veteran diplomat Elliot Abrams says marks “a new hostility” and “actually accuses Israel of no longer being interested in a negotiated settlement. ” Writing on the Council of Foreign Relations blog, Abrams says a statement criticizing new Israeli housing construction in East Jerusalem also “reflects pure ignorance. ” For one thing, it refers to East Jerusalem “settlements. ” Says Abrams: “The term ‘settlement’ loses meaning when applied to Jews building homes in their nation’s capital city. ” Ironically, the statement comes on the heels of a Saudi delegation arriving for talks in Israel: “When the Saudis have a more realistic approach to Israel than the State Department,” he writes, “American policy is far out of whack. ” Demands by some  are founded in a false memory of years past, according to Brooklyn College Professor Robert Cherry. “Unfortunately, there are quite a few people who have accepted the myth that CUNY was free until the 1970s,” he writes at Gotham Gazette. But “this was only true for those students who were accepted into the day school. ” By the ’60s, a majority of CUNY students attended the night schools, which carried “a substantial tuition charge. ” Moreover, “today a larger share of CUNY students have no tuition obligation than did in the   free era. ” And given the need for intensive remedial work for poorly prepared students, he writes, a blanket end to tuition would stretch resources past the breaking point. Political analyst George Korda, writing in the Knoxville News Sentinel,   to task for not speaking out more on the economy  —   specifically, the fact that “the U. S. is nearing $20 trillion in national debt, nearly double what it was 10 years ago. ” In their acceptance speeches, he notes, neither candidate “mentioned the danger contained within this massive debt or the reality that America doesn’t have the money to do such grandiose things as they’re promising without even more grandiose borrowing or taxation. ” Indeed, he writes, both Clinton and Triump “have nothing to offer but ‘the sky’s the limit and we’re going to be rich again.’ ”",0,0,0,0,0,0,89

"," The Trump administration sent shockwaves through the historically black college community by suggesting in a statement on Friday night that a funding program for black college campuses may unconstitutionally allocate federal money on the basis of race. A source close to the administration said that the statement “blindsided” many inside the White House, as well as in the Education Department, which have both spent significant time and energy wooing HBCUs  —   hoping to improve on a rocky relationship the schools had with the Obama administration. The Friday statement on the government funding bill pointed to a longstanding program that gives funding for construction projects on the campuses of black colleges as one that allocates benefits “on the basis of race, ethnicity, and gender. ” The administration, the statement said, would “treat the provisions   …     in a manner consistent with the requirement to afford equal protection of the laws. ” Two sources said the initial statement singling out black colleges had bypassed those who had worked on HBCU issues. “The timing of this was crazy  …     It totally blindsided the White House domestic policy staff and all of the key players on this issue, and it subsequently blindsided the HBCU community,” said a second source with direct knowledge of the situation. “It was a   statement,” the source said, that black colleges saw as “literally attacking not just HBCUs but Native Americans. ” Friday’s White House statement also indicated that a housing block grant program for Native Americans included in the omnibus bill might be similarly unconstitutional. But black college groups said they were not concerned that the administration would actually pull back any funding. In a statement, Johnny Taylor, president of the HBCU advocacy group the Thurgood Marshall College Fund, said he had received assurances that “there was absolutely no plan to eliminate or challenge this program. ” The program in question, Taylor said, does not allocate money on the basis of race, since historically black colleges also serve large numbers of white and Latino students. The Education Department and White House advisor Omarosa Manigault, who helped push the initiative on historically black colleges, did not respond to a request for comment. But in another White House statement released late Sunday night, Trump said he was committed to using funds as consistent with the Constitution  —   and that he continued to support HBCUs. “The statement that accompanied my signing of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017, sets forth my intention to spend the funds it appropriates, including the funds for Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) consistently with my responsibilities under the Constitution,” Trump said. “It does not affect my unwavering support for HBCUs and their critical educational missions. ” Trump also pointed to his executive order related to supporting HBCUs, and to the upcoming commencement address Education Secretary Betsy DeVos is scheduled to give at     University. In a statement of her own on Sunday, DeVos said she is a “strong supporter” of HBCUs. Darren Sands contributed reporting.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,91

Proceeds go towards scholarships for aspiring journalists, and the event normally hosts a comedian who mocks the President and other members of the press. In a statement, WHCA president Jeff Mason said the event will go ahead as planned, saying that “We look forward to shining a spotlight at the dinner on some of the best political journalism of the past year and recognizing the promising students who represent the next generation of our profession. ” In 2011, Trump was taunted by both Barack Obama and the dinner’s comedian Seth Myers about a possible presidential run.

94,94,3636,56945,78234,Trump Time Capsule #112: Gennifer Flowers,Atlantic,James Fallows,2016-09-24,2016.0,9.0,,"People will look back on this era in our history to see what was known about Donald Trump while Americans were deciding whether to choose him as president. Here’s a running chronicle from James Fallows on the evidence available to voters as they make their choice, and of how Trump has broken the norms that applied to previous   candidates. Donald Trump tweeted today that he has invited Gennifer Flowers, subject of controversies involving Bill Clinton’s infidelities when he was governor of Arkansas, to sit in the front row during his first debate next week against Hillary Clinton. This is in apparent retaliation for Hillary Clinton’s reportedly inviting Mark Cuban,   billionaire, to sit at the debate. Flowers soon confirmed that she had accepted the invitation. Obvious   point #1: Nothing like this has happened in a   race before.   point #2: Trump is running against the first female   nominee in U. S. history. And he focuses attention, in this important first debate, on a   controversy? Involving the nominee’s husband? Whom she has stayed with  through more than 40 years of marriage? And whom the Republican party of the 1990s destroyed itself trying to impeach? Talk about impulse control. Most campaign ads, like most billboards or commercials, are unimaginative and formulaic. Our candidate is great! Their candidate is terrible! Choose us! With the huge majority of political ads, you would look back on them long after the campaign only for   curio purposes —  Look at the clothes they wore in the ’80s! Look how corny “I like Ike!” was as a slogan! Look how young [Mitch McConnell   Bill Clinton   Al Gore] once was! —  or to find archeological samples of the political mood of a given era. The few   ads that are remembered earn their place either because they were so effective in shifting the tone of the campaign, as with George H. W. Bush’s   “Revolving Door” ad against Michael Dukakis in 1988 or because they so clearly presented the candidate in the desired light, as with Ronald Reagan’s famous “Morning in America” ad in 1984. Perhaps the most effective campaign advertisement ever, especially considering that it was aired only one time, was Lyndon Johnson’s devastating “Daisy Girl” ad, from his campaign against Barry Goldwater in 1964. The power of the Daisy Girl ad was of course its dramatizing the warning that Goldwater might recklessly bring on a nuclear war. *** It’s impossible to judge these things in real time, but I think there’s a good chance that “Mirrors,” an ad released this week by the Hillary Clinton campaign and shown after the jump, is another one that people will look back on. You can say what you want about Hillary Clinton’s performance skills as a campaigner, and we’ll have another important chance to assess them just two days from now in the first debate. (Preview here.) But I think it is hard to dispute that her   team is very skillful. Consider also their “Role Models” ad from two months ago: Noting this for the record, with 44 days and a few hours to go, as one more aspect of the 2016 campaign that people may   years from now. Probably because she is so very familiar a figure on the U. S. political scene, Hillary Clinton’s pioneering role as potentially America’s first female president has attracted less sizzle than the   Barack Obama did during the 2008 campaign, as potentially the first black president. But an ad like “Mirrors” may make the point more pointedly than another “glass ceiling” speech. Today’s harvest of things that haven’t happened in presidential campaigns before: 1. Diplomats. As the Washington Post reported yesterday, some 75 former prominent former ambassadors and other diplomats, from Republican and Democratic administrations alike, signed an open letter opposing Donald Trump and, more strikingly, going on outright to endorse Hillary Clinton. The full text of the letter and list of names is here. Sample of their argument: We have served Republican and Democratic Presidents with pride and enthusiasm. None of us will vote for Donald J. Trump. Each of us endorses Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine. Because the stakes in this election are so high, this is the first time many of us have publicly endorsed a candidate for President. Very simply, this election is different from any election we can recall. One of the candidates —  Donald J. Trump —  is entirely unqualified to serve as President and   .   …     We fear the damage that such ineptitude could cause in our closest relationships as well as the succor it might offer our enemies. By contrast, Hillary Clinton’s handling of foreign affairs has consistently sought to advance fundamental U. S. interests with a deep grounding in the work of the many tens of thousands of career officers on whom our national security depends. Not every one of us has agreed with every decision she made (and the same would be true of every one of her predecessors) but we have profound respect for her skills, dedication, intelligence, and diplomacy. If you’ve followed international affairs, you’ll recognize a lot of names on this list, including a number who were prominent under Republican presidents Nixon, Reagan, and both Bushes. This statement follows similar       statements by former intelligence officers,   officials and scholars, military figures, and others, as summarized in dispatch #109. Some veterans of the   world express their preferences during each election. I am aware of nothing comparable to this, from usually    career diplomats. It’s a bookend to the   statement from 50 Republican former cabinet members and other senior officials, who said Trump would be “the most reckless president in American history. ” *** 2. The Boss. In some different political world, you might imagine Donald Trump being so authentic a vessel for the interests of   America that Bruce Springsteen would want to tour with and support him. (This 2014 Politico article by Marc Dolan about Springsteen’s political evolution, from apolitical rock star to someone conscious of being a voice of the working class, is fascinating.) Instead, in a new interview with Brian Hitt of Rolling Stone, Springsteen leads off by saying: The republic is under siege by a moron, basically. The whole thing is tragic. Without overstating it, it’s a tragedy for our democracy. In the context of “under siege by a moron,” the brilliant teaser for Frontline’s The Choice is worth watching very closely. The final minute of this video has become famous in the past 24 hours, for Omarosa Manigault’s soliloquy:  “Every critic, every detractor, will have to bow down to President Trump. It’s everyone who’s ever doubted Donald, who ever disagreed, who ever challenged him. It is the ultimate revenge to become the most powerful man in the universe. ”      But the   clip as a whole suggests that rage at being disrespected is a very important part of Trump’s drive right now. The clip focuses on Barack Obama’s relentless public mockery of Trump at the White House Correspondents Dinner five years ago. I was there at the time, in easy eyeshot of Trump, and I recall him looking even more steamingly bitter than you can see in this clip. Frontline suggests that those few minutes of public ridicule played more than a small part in the “siege by a moron” predicament the U. S. confronts today. Whether or not that stands up, it’s obvious that the quest to dominate, to be seen as dominant, to humiliate, to get revenge, plays an even larger part in Trump’s mixture of motivation than for politicians as a whole. The theme of “I’ll show them!” is of course familiar in our politics. Lyndon Johnson was going to show the   boys who looked down on him. Richard Nixon was going to show everybody. Jimmy Carter was   of   snobbery. And on down a long list. But what we’re seeing with this man is something new. *** 3. Enquirer. In installment #97 I noted that the Dallas Morning News, whose editorial page is as reliably conservative as any in the country, came out and endorsed Hillary Clinton. The    Richmond Times Dispatch took the   step of endorsing Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson. Today the Cincinnati Enquirer, a rival to the DMN for   title, joined it in an editorial titled “It has to be Hillary. ” Sample of the argument: The Enquirer has supported Republicans for president for almost a century —  a tradition this editorial board doesn’t take lightly. But this is not a traditional race, and these are not traditional times. Our country needs calm, thoughtful leadership to deal with the challenges we face at home and abroad. We need a leader who will bring out the best in all Americans, not the worst. That’s why there is only one choice when we elect a president in November: Hillary Clinton. I am a Democrat by voting history and   liberal in most policy preferences. My esteem for   conservatives and   Republicans who are willing to recognize the reality of Trump steadily rises. If Trump had remained a Democrat and somehow became that party’s nominee, I would swallow hard and vote for any   Republican who ran against him. Thus I respect the conservatives and Republicans who are taking the counterpart step. *** So it stands with 45 days until the election, three days until the first debate, and still no tax data forthcoming from Trump —  a point the Enquirer addressed this way: His refusal to release his tax returns draws into question both Trump’s true income and whether he is paying his fair share of taxes. Even if you consider Trump a successful businessman, running a government is not the same as being the CEO of a company. The United States cannot file bankruptcy to avoid paying its debts. Robert Gates is as experienced a   figure as America now has. He joined the Air Force when Lyndon Johnson was president and has served under every president, Republican and Democratic, since then. He was deputy CIA director under Ronald Reagan, CIA director under the first George Bush, and Secretary of Defense under both the second George Bush and the only Barack Obama. He is also very   in bureaucratic, domestic, and international politics, as his long record of appointments might suggest and as his surprisingly   memoir Duty makes clear. In foreign policy he is more “realist” than neocon. In an essay for the the Wall Street Journal this week, Gates takes a little time getting to his conclusion, including laying out the reasons he’s lukewarm to (his onetime Cabinet colleague) Hillary Clinton. But conclude he does, in forthright terms: At least on national security, I believe Mr. Trump is beyond repair. He is stubbornly uninformed about the world and how to lead our country and government, and temperamentally unsuited to lead our men and women in uniform. He is unqualified and unfit to be   . *** If you’re keeping score at home, here are some of the senior figures who have declared Donald Trump “unfit,” “dangerous,” “reckless,” or in other ways unsuitable for service as President: So it stands with 47 days to go, no tax records or  . Bornstein medical information forthcoming, and the Republican establishment saying: He’s fine. To say it once more: nothing like this has happened before. *** Colin Powell? Condi Rice? George Tenet? Your G. W.   Cabinet colleagues Robert Gates, and before him Henry Paulson, Michael Hayden, Michael Chertoff, John Negroponte, Tom Ridge, and others have set the precedent of doing the right thing. Dick Cheney will never do so, but you have the opportunity, and not just in leaked emails. Without elaboration, here is a    note of some publicized news of the past few days: 1. George H. W. Bush. For the first time in modern history, a former president of one party has said he will vote for a nominee from the other party.   The president who is taking this step is of course the senior George Bush, who this week reportedly told a crowd of 40 people that he plans to vote for Hillary Clinton. Set aside the ensuing flap over whether Bush “intended” something he said in front of several dozen people to become “public. ” (If you want to keep something confidential, you don’t say it in a crowd. You especially understand this point if you are yourself a former U. S. president and vice president plus CIA director, with two sons who ran for the White House and one who made it. And once the news got out, Bush’s spokesmen didn’t even deny it. He just said that Bush’s vote would be “private,” which is code for “the report is true. ”) Ill will between the Bush and Trump empires is no surprise. Just think back to the days of Trump mocking “  Jeb,” or of Barbara Bush saying early this year that she was “sick of Trump. ” But to the best of my knowledge, this is the   case of a former president from one party saying that he would vote for a nominee from the other party.*       —   Even in 1964, the esteemed former Republican president Dwight Eisenhower officially “supported” the highly controversial Republican nominee Barry Goldwater.       —   Even in 1972, the beleaguered former Democratic president Lyndon Johnson technically endorsed the controversial Democratic nominee George McGovern, who had built his campaign on opposition to Johnson’s own Vietnam war. But in 2016, with 47 days and a few hours until the election, we take another step into the unknown. (*The Bull Moose   Republican tussle between Teddy Roosevelt and W. H. Taft in 1912 was a special case that doesn’t apply. The counterpart to today’s   news would be if Teddy Roosevelt, as a former Republican president, had endorsed Woodrow Wilson, the Democrat, rather than endorsing himself for another run at the White House.) *** 2. Fahrenthold and the Trump Foundation. This campaign has revealed a lot about our country, much of it unsettling. It is also revealing things both good and bad about our news media, in ways that are changing and unfolding every day, and that I’ll try to say more about sometime soon. For now I’ll say: it’s impressive to see the NYT’s recent embrace of the “let’s call a lie a ‘lie’” philosophy it is alarming that CNN has kept right on with Corey Lewandowski as a paid “analyst” while he is still on Donald Trump’s payroll, and it is encouraging for journalism in general and the Washington Post in particular that David Fahrenthold continues his extraordinary work on the Trump Foundation. The story posted last night, about the foundation’s role in paying off legal claims against Trump’s   businesses, is roughly ten times more dramatic —  in evidentiary support, and in clarity of offense —  than even the worst allegations about the Clinton Foundation. You can read the details yourself, but here’s a sample from the story: “I represent 700 nonprofits a year, and I’ve never encountered anything so brazen,” said Jeffrey Tenenbaum, who advises charities at the Venable law firm in Washington. After The Washington Post described the details of these Trump Foundation gifts, Tenenbaum described them as “really shocking. ” “If he’s using other people’s money  —   run through his foundation  —   to satisfy his personal obligations, then that’s about as blatant an example of   [as] I’ve seen in awhile,” Tenenbaum said. For Time Capsule purposes: through the centuries of U. S. history, various nominees have of course had their swirls of financial controversy. Lyndon Johnson’s rise to wealth was complex enough to occupy hundreds of pages of Robert Caro’s oeuvre. George W. Bush, of course born to a rich and prominent family, benefited greatly from a favorable deal involving the Texas Rangers. Spiro Agnew had to resign as vice president for taking cash bribes while in office. Suspicions that “something” must be awry with the Clinton family’s Whitewater dealings occupied the press and special investigators through much of the 1990s. And so on. But to the best of my knowledge, nothing ever known or suspected about any previous   nominee comes close to what is now on the record about Donald Trump and his foundation. And still he remains the only modern candidate to refuse to release his tax returns. And still the solons of his party say, He’s fine. *** 3. Kagan. Something must have happened yesterday to bring a    article to broader attention. I received several notes from readers wanting to be sure I’d seen an old WaPo essay by Robert Kagan. I disagree with Robert Kagan on just about everything. But in the months since he originally published his essay, called “This Is How Fascism Comes to America,”  I think his arguments have come to seem more rather than less relevant. Especially this, with emphasis added: We’re supposed to believe that Trump’s support stems from economic stagnation or dislocation. Maybe some of it does. But what Trump offers his followers are not economic remedies  —   his proposals change daily. What he offers is an attitude, an aura of crude strength and machismo, a boasting disrespect for the niceties of the democratic culture that he claims, and his followers believe, has produced national weakness and incompetence. His incoherent and contradictory utterances have one thing in common: They provoke and play on feelings of resentment and disdain, intermingled with bits of fear, hatred and anger. His public discourse consists of attacking or ridiculing a wide range of “others”  —   Muslims, Hispanics, women, Chinese, Mexicans, Europeans, Arabs, immigrants, refugees  —   whom he depicts either as threats or as objects of derision. His program, such as it is, consists chiefly of promises to get tough with foreigners and people of nonwhite complexion. He will deport them, bar them, get them to knuckle under, make them pay up or make them shut up. Please also read Garrett Epps’s essay yesterday, to parallel sobering effect. All this is part of what the country knows about this candidate, as it considers whether to make him president and what the likes of Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell know as well, as they stand beside him. For the past few days Donald Trump has been saying that Hillary Clinton and her campaign launched the racist “birther” smear against Barack Obama. Birtherism was a lie, as Trump now   admits. But his claim that birtherism started with Hillary Clinton, in her losing campaign against Barack Obama in 2008, is a   lie. For details, check back on installment #105 or an admirably direct story yesterday in the New York Times with the admirably blunt headline: “Donald Trump Clung to ‘Birther’ Lie for Years, and Still Isn’t Apologetic. ” Today Trump’s campaign manager Kellyanne Conway, who generally has been playing the Good Cop in presenting a nicer version of Bad Cop Trump’s own arguments, went on Meet the Press and pinned specific blame for the supposed   birther campaign on Sidney Blumenthal —  author, former Bill Clinton staffer, and   Hillary Clinton ally. Based on everything I know, which includes some   experience, I view this as almost certainly yet another lie. It’s disappointing, to put it mildly, to hear Kellyanne Conway retailing it and so far being allowed to get away with doing so. *** Here is the real sequence of birtherism, as I’m aware of it: “A new poll finds 58 percent of Republicans doubt Obama is American. Orly Taitz, the mastermind behind the Obama   controversy, tells The Daily Beast’s Max Blumenthal why the president should be jailed. ”   In 2011, Donald Trump took up the mantle from Orly Taitz, and from then until very recently became the most prominent birther theorist. *** Now, where do Hillary Clinton and Sid Blumenthal fit into this narrative? As far as I can tell, and to the best of my   experience, they fit in only in an entirely fictitious way. As discussed before in this space, I have known Sid Blumenthal for a very long time, since we were   magazine writers in DC in the 1980s. We’ve agreed on many things and disagreed on others. The disagreements notably involved the 2008 Democratic primaries, in which he was a strong Hillary Clinton partisan and I favored Barack Obama (mainly because of their respective stands on the Iraq war). I think Sid Blumenthal’s magazine and book journalism of the 1980s and 1990s stands up very well. I think A   Man, the first installment of his   saga on Abraham Lincoln, is a magnificent look at 19th century American political, economic, and cultural history, with understated but impressive resonance for our current day. During the intensity of the   primary campaign cycle, even though I was living in China, I was on Sid Blumenthal’s email list for frequent (several times daily) updates on the state of the campaign. Mostly these updates involved why Hillary Clinton would be a stronger Democratic nominee, and Barack Obama would be weaker. They talked about   experience. They talked about possible Republican lines of attack. They talked about the way the smear machine that had maligned John Kerry on the fraudulent “Swift Boat” attack might be arrayed against Obama. But not once, to the best of my   knowledge, did they ever mention citizenship, birtherism, or Kenya. Just now I’ve gone back through my email archives again. The words “Kenya,” “citizenship,” “birth certificate,” and related terms do not appear in any of the very large corpus of mail I received from Sid Blumenthal in 2007 and 2008. Sid has his critics and his flaws, like any of us. But the idea that he either originated or propagated the birther view of Obama, to the best of my knowledge, is phony. Remember Max Blumenthal, author of the takedown of Orly Taitz and her fantasies in 2009? He is Sid and Jackie Blumenthal’s son. *** The article on which Kellyanne Conway based today’s attack is here. See if you find it credible I do not. A very thorough deconstruction of it, by a conservative writer, is here. Sample: Here’s what we’re lacking from [the author of the accusatory article] (that could be reasonably asked of him): Asher has provided none of this, nor has he hinted at being able to provide any of this. Instead, the only thing he has offered is Blumenthal’s business card. Further deconstruction from The Washington Monthly is here. The author of TWM’s piece, D. R. Tucker, makes a point similar to my own: It’s profoundly unlikely that Blumenthal would encourage journalists to pursue a path of inquiry that a) was ridiculous on its face, b) would obviously lead nowhere and c) would make both himself and Clinton look like colossal fools. Why does this qualify for Time Capsule notice? Because I’m not aware of a previous case in which a nominee has trafficked in claims that a sitting president was illegitimately in office (because, by birther logic, he was not legally eligible) —  nor tried, via psychological projection, to blame these false claims on someone else once forced to admit they were lies. It’s 50 days and a few hours until the election one nominee has refused to release his tax information and the Republican leadership continues to say, “He’s fine!” This evening, in Miami, the Republican nominee for president referred to his opponent and said (emphasis added): “I think that her bodyguards should drop all weapons,” Mr. Trump said at a rally in Miami. “I think they should disarm. Immediately. What do you think. Yes? Take their guns away. She doesn’t want guns. Take them. Let’s see what happens to her. Take their guns away, O. K. It will be very dangerous. ” I am aware of only one other case in which a   nominee has “joked” about bodily harm against his opponent. As it happens, that was from this same Donald Trump, five weeks ago saying (in installment #73) that “the Second Amendment people” might be able to do something about Hillary Clinton’s ability to appoint Supreme Court justices. I’ll say it again: Nothing like this has ever happened before. It’s 52+ days until the election the tax returns (and  . Bornstein health reports) still not forthcoming and Republican leaders still saying: Sure, he’s fine!   I think this day, 52 days before the election, is one that people will look back on. At his press conference    hotel promo   endorsement spectacle just now in Washington, D. C. Donald Trump said this, and only this, about the   “birther” controversy that for years he led and whipped up: Now, not to mention her in the same breath, but Hillary Clinton and her campaign of 2008 started the birther controversy. I finished it.  I finished it.  You know what I mean. President Barack Obama was born in the United States, period. Now we all want to get back to making America strong and great again. In detail: *** An ongoing theme of these time capsules, and a major focus of the Primary Concerns podcast I did with Brian Beutler this week, is the difficulty the “normal” press has had in coming to terms with a man who simply and continually lies, without the normal internal checks that hold most people back. In particular we discussed the differing arcs of the New York Times and the Washington Post in grappling with this issue. Over the past decade, the NYT has become more and more obviously the dominant American news organization, and the Post has coped with many constraints and cutbacks. But in the past few months the news page of the Post has seemed much more direct in calling out what is happening. Beutler and I go into details of this in our discussion. But here is an example, the contrasting   notifications the two papers put out, with the Times at the top and the Post at the bottom. And the polls continue to draw closer, and the Republican leadership continues to say: Sure, this guy is fine. Mainly because he’s talented, partly because of the similarity of our names, I’ve paid attention to Jimmy Fallon from the start. Effective 53 days from now, he may have a lot to answer for. Performances like the one he put on this evening with Donald Trump, including a “charming” mussing of the candidate’s famous hair, are a crucial part of the “normalizing” process of a candidate who is outside all historical norms for this office. In my current cover story I wrote:   Trump’s rise through the primary debates, and his celebrations of successive victories at rallies in between, made it appear that one of his gifts was the ability to combine unvarying emphases and messages with a wide range of dramatic styles. One day he was egging on huge crowds by picking out scattered protesters and yelling, “Get ’em outta here!” The next day he was talking earnestly with sympathetic hosts on Fox News or conservative   shows —  and then in the evening chatting urbanely, in a “we’re all New Yorkers here” style that was a less risqué version of his old radio exchanges with Howard Stern, to win over presumptively less sympathetic figures such as Jimmy Fallon and Jimmy Kimmel on their shows. Last November, Trump served as host (and danced in a parody rap video) on Saturday Night Live. In February, just after the New Hampshire primary, Stephen Colbert allowed Trump to phone in to his Late Show —  and Colbert, for once overmatched, ended up making Trump seem as if he was in on all the jokes rather than the object of them. One reason for Trump’s rise has been the effective merger of the entertainment and   industries. Jimmy Fallon accelerated that process tonight. He did so on the same day in which Trump put out a crazy economic plan and still refused to say that the incumbent (black) president was a “real” American. Fallon’s humoring of Trump was a bad move, a destructive and   mistake, which I hope Fallon becomes embarrassed about but the rest of us don’t have   reason to rue. This one is just a note for the record. Please recall the sequence: Finally today two campaign representatives shifted the rationale, as if the previous one had not existed, to one that is more completely indefensible. First Donald Trump Jr. then campaign ally Jack Kingston said that that Trump Sr. couldn’t release the returns because people might find things in them. As Trump Jr. who tends to make his father’s points with less finesse, said in an interview with the Pittsburgh  : When asked why his father has not released his tax returns as presidential candidates have traditionally done, Trump Jr. said, “Because he’s got a   tax return that would create   …     financial auditors out of every person in the country asking questions that would distract from [his father’s] main message. ” Kingston, a former congressman who now works for one of D. C.’s biggest lobbying firms but is part of Trump’s “ ” team, made a similar point today on CNN: “If you put it on the table, you’re going to have 300 million Americans   what is this, what is that?” Of course, asking what is that? aka “” is why public officials have to make financial disclosures. It’s why both Kingston and Donald Trump Sr. and presumably Donald Trump Jr. as well, were hammering Hillary Clinton to release her emails. If all the information in medical records, financial reports, or official emails were flattering, no one would be required to release it. It’s only because it can lead to “ ” that it’s expected of public officials. *** I’m noting this in real time, at a moment when like so many other flaps it’s prominent on talk shows and news feeds. But like so many other “never before!” episodes in the Trump campaign, it’s likely soon to become “normalized,” and fade. I note that with 53 days until the election, and with polls tightening, a nominee continues to defy a norm that his modern predecessors have all respected —  and that his campaign has stepped away from his previous rationalized excuse and, out of nothing, invented a new alibi. And his party’s leaders say: That’s fine. People will look back on this time. We could be entering the Era of Hourly Time Capsules, in part because I need to make up for the past few days away from The Internet. To note this    highly publicized episode before it gets sandblasted from public memory by whatever is about to happen next: Yesterday, in Flint, Michigan, Donald Trump revealed a trait that is strikingly recurrent in his own behavior, and strikingly different from what I can recall from any other presidential nominee. That trait is the combination of his bombast about women when they are not present, and his reluctance or inability to confront them   . The man is a bully, and like most bullies he is a coward. I don’t know of any other nominee in modern times of whom that was so clearly true. (Richard Nixon gave all the signs of not being physically courageous, but he rhetorically he did not show the stark contrast between being           that Trump does with women who challenge him.) This is something I discuss in my current cover story, involving the three distinct moments in the primary season when Trump looked worst in live exchanges: Donald Trump was made to look bad by one interviewer with the time, preparation, and guts to pursue a line of questioning, and by two women who discussed right in front of him the ugly things he has said. If he shows up for this fall’s debates, he’ll encounter moderators with a lot of time to explore issues, and a woman with decades of onstage toughness behind her. And it’s what you saw in this   showdown in Flint, in which Trump meekly accepted correction in person from Pastor Faith Green Timmons, when she told him he was not supposed to be making a political speech —  and then, once safely out of her gaze,   lied about what had happened and had been captured on tape. Here is what Trump told the   Fox and Friends this morning: “Something was up,” Trump told Fox and Friends on Thursday morning, calling the Rev. Faith Green Timmons a “nervous mess. ” “I noticed she was so nervous when she introduced me,” he said. “When she got up to introduce me she was so nervous, she was shaking. I said, wow, this is kind of strange. Then she came up. So she had that in mind, there’s no question. ” And here is what actually occurred: *** Bonus     point: NPR’s Scott Detrow did a very strong and pointed post contrasting the way Trump described the Flint episode and what actually occurred there. But here is the way NPR headlined his post: “Misstates Key Facts”? What, exactly, would be wrong with the word “lies”? More in the hopper. Remember the episode of “the Star,” reported back in installment #33? It was only two months ago, but it seems forever. Way back in July, Donald Trump retweeted an item showing Hillary Clinton awash in a sea of cash, with the message “Most Corrupt Candidate Ever!” emblazoned on a   star. Criticism quickly arose about the overlap with classic     imagery, much as if Trump had used an image of blacks eating watermelon or Mexicans dozing under their sombreros. Fairly quickly Trump took the    step of actually deleting his tweet. But even then his campaign’s reaction was outraged innocence.  ? What are you talking about?? Why would you think it’s a Star of David? It’s so obviously a sheriff’s badge! The real racists are the ones who think anything else! That’s what this weekend’s “Pepe” episode reminds me of. As a reminder: Hillary Clinton set the stage with her   comment about the “basket of deplorables. ” Then the stylish and unembarrassable Trump ally Roger Stone responded with the    movie poster you see above, which Donald Trump Jr. then shared on Instagram, as shown below: Why is this like “the Star”? Because of Pepe the Frog. For some people, what I’m about to say is old news and obvious. But for many, perhaps most, it’s important to have the whole context laid out. If you’ve spent any time in the thickets of “ ” activism in recent years, you know perfectly well who Pepe is and what he stands for. In the “Deplorables” poster he is of course the figure with green skin and   hair standing alongside The Man. But to people who would actually fit “the deplorables” standard of racial animus, Pepe is also the   insiders’ symbol not just of racism but even of outright exterminationism. You can read an account of Pepe’s recent history via the Daily Beast a few months ago here. He also has a   internet meme history, which you can see here. I’m not going to share the Pepe variants I keep getting in the mail, but they include: Pepe as a sly smiling   operator, inviting Jews to take a “shower” Pepe working the crematoria, after the gas chambers have done their job Pepe at the glorious new southern Wall, grinning at the plight of Mexicans trapped on the other side Pepe as an Orthodox Jew, smirking (because of the “inside job”) as the World Trade Centers come down 15 years ago Pepe with a lynch mob. Again, it’s old news, and that is the point. If you’re involved in politics, you know this. You know exactly what the image of Pepe signifies in political uses these days. So for the son and namesake of the Republican nominee to share with pride a poster including Pepe necessarily means either that he does not know about Pepe, which indicates incompetence —  or that he does, which indicates something worse. *** The episode should be more disturbing than the conceivably misunderstood   star. In that case, an innocent if unlikely alternative explanation was at hand: No, really, it is just a sheriff’s star! What’s wrong with you, that you would think anything else? But in this case, there is no “nice” version of contemporary political Pepe to fall back on. (Oh, you thought we meant the one from the death camps? Not at all! We meant the one from the lynchings! Sorry for the confusion.) With eight weeks to go until the election, this is what Donald Trump Jr. has been “honored” to send out.

95,95,37302,38401,57246,Trump to give immigration speech amid major questions,CNN,Eric Bradner,2016-08-28,2016.0,8.0,,"Washington (CNN) Donald Trump said Sunday night he plans to make a ”major speech” on immigration during his stop in Arizona on Wednesday. ”I will be making a major speech on ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION on Wednesday in the GREAT State of Arizona. Big crowds, looking for a larger venue,” Trump’s tweet said.  Trump’s immigration policy received renewed scrutiny recently after he seemingly softened his stance on how to treat undocumented immigrants and then reaffirmed his support for deporting them. He’s been consistent on a few points, however: building a   border wall, ”extreme vetting” of new immigrants and deportations of those who commit crimes. Days after Trump stepped away from one of his signature policy positions, top surrogates    including vice presidential nominee Mike Pence and campaign manager Kellyanne Conway    offered unclear takes Sunday on where Trump stands.  Trump spokeswoman Katrina Pierson says none of it is really that complicated, however. ”He hasn’t changed his position on immigration. He’s changed the words that he is saying,” she said Thursday on CNN. Trump: No legal status for undocumented immigrants, Here’s what we know    and don’t know    about Trump’s immigration policy:  Undocumented immigrants, During the Republican presidential primary, an animating policy of Trump’s campaign was his hardline stance on immigration. He first floated the prospect of a ”deportation force” to boot all undocumented immigrants from the country    no matter how long they’d been in the United States    during an interview in November 2015, and later defended it in a December primary debate. In recent days, Trump has backed away from that rhetoric    if not the policies.  ”There could certainly be a softening” in his immigration proposals, Trump told Fox News’ Sean Hannity Tuesday night, ”because we’re not looking to hurt people.” So has he scrapped the idea of removing all undocumented immigrants from the country? Trump wouldn’t say later in the week, in an interview with CNN’s Anderson Cooper.  ”There is a very good chance the answer could be yes,” Trump said when asked if he would deport those who have lived here peacefully but without papers. ”We’re going to see what happens.” Trump was set to deliver a major speech on illegal immigration last week, but his campaign decided to postpone the address as it continues to craft its policy and the language to deliver it. Deportation force  Trump running mate Mike Pence gave the GOP nominee some wiggle room on actually implementing that deportation force in an interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper on ”State of the Union” Sunday, downplaying it as merely a ”mechanism” to carry out Trump’s   ideas. ”Well, what you heard him describe there, in his usual plainspoken, American way, was a mechanism, not a policy. I mean, you’re going to hear more detail in next two weeks that lays out all the policies,” Pence said.  Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus admitted on NBC’s ”Meet the Press” that his party’s nominee is considering changing his previous position, calling the issue complicated    even though Trump had ignored those complexities in the primary. ”He did simplify it. But now he’s reflecting on it and his position is going to be known,” Priebus said.  Bottom line: Would undocumented immigrants have to leave the United States? That’s what CBS’ John Dickerson asked Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway on Sunday.  ”That’s really the question here, John,” Conway said, leaving it unanswered.  ’Anchor babies’  Trump also made headlines during the primary for using the term ”anchor babies” to describe the   children of undocumented immigrants    suggesting he didn’t support the citizenship status granted by the Constitution to those children.  Tapper pressed Pence Sunday on whether the GOP ticket believes those children are citizens.  ”Well, I think the whole question of anchor babies, as it’s known, the whole question of citizenship, of   Americans is a subject for the future,” he said. ”I think the American people ought to ask it. We look at our whole immigration system and see whether that works and makes sense.”",0,0,0,0,0,0,95
96,96,29780,133242,200934,A new swing state poll brings good news for Hillary Clinton,Vox,Katie Hicks,2016/6/21,2016.0,6.0,http://www.vox.com/2016/6/21/11990868/clinton-leads-poll-in-3-swing-states," A new poll puts presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton ahead of  —   or neck and neck with  —   Republican Donald Trump in several key swing states.    The poll, conducted by Quinnipiac University, gives Clinton an 8 percentage point lead over Trump in Florida ( ) as well as a tie in Ohio ( ) and a minor lead in Pennsylvania ( ). The Ohio and Pennsylvania results are both within the margin of error. RealClearPolitics, which aggregates findings from multiple surveys, puts Clinton at a lead of 2. 7 points in Ohio and a lead of 0. 5 points in Pennsylvania  —   still good news for the Clinton campaign. The poll found that voters in each state believe Clinton to have higher moral standards, to be more intelligent, and to be better prepared than Trump to be president.    Voters were divided on whether they find Trump to be more honest and trustworthy than Clinton. However, they said he would do a better job at creating jobs and combating terrorism.    Peter Brown, assistant director of the Quinnipiac poll, said that Trump’s disconnect with the Republican Party and recent remarks have hurt his numbers. ”The   bitter verbal battles between Trump and some Republican leaders is showing in these numbers,” Brown said in remarks released with the poll. ”In these three key states, Clinton is doing better, and in the case of Florida much better, among Democrats than Trump is among Republicans. Traditionally GOP presidential candidates score better on this party loyalty test.”    According to Brown, Trump’s comments on Judge Gonzalo Curiel and people of Mexican heritage are likely to blame for his low numbers in Florida, which has a larger Hispanic population than the other two states.

Clinton then mockingly assumed the voice of angry Americans. “I’m mad about immigration, I’m mad about trade, I’m mad because my wages aren’t going up,” Clinton said, painting the divide in the country as a battle between “the voters of Hope vs. the voters of fear. ” “Most of the   feeling in America is in places that don’t have a lot of immigrants. We’ve got to stop fighting over this,” Clinton said. He noted that the election should not be about “insults, tax evasion, abuse of the family foundation or whatever” because that’s not what matters to regular people. “The Democrats have a pretty good argument. I made it four years ago for President Obama,” Clinton said. “Is this a change election? Yes it is, and it should be. But the question should be: what are we going to do? What kind of change do you need?  …    Do we want anger or answers? Do we want resentment or empowerment? And do we want to reach the world with walls or bridges?” “That’s it. That’s the whole thing,” Clinton said to mild applause. Clinton said that we can’t “put everyone in manufacturing” because “every year, fewer people can produce more stuff. ” Clinton came out in favor of tariffs on companies that ship jobs overseas, specifically citing the case of Carrier air conditioners in Indiana in a direct ripoff of one of Donald Trump’s main talking points. “No we’re going to take the gains away from you if you do that,” he said. “That is Hillary’s position. ” “Oh, the Democrats they’re coming for your guns, they’re coming for your guns. They said that about me. And we banned assault weapons” but everyone in Michigan was still able to go hunting and protect their families, Clinton said. “It is a bunch of bull!” Clinton made a bizarre reference to the Civil War, paraphrasing a friend who is a Lincoln expert who explained one of the reasons Lincoln went to war: “In the North there was no power elite, there was no slave labor, it was the greatest opportunity for people who started out poor to get into the middle class. We’ve got to do that again. ”",0,0,0,0,0,0,97

Appearing on CNN’s “New Day,” Tyler said that if Palin endorses Trump as rumored, it would not be a blow to Cruz’s campaign but a blow to Governor Palin: “I think it [would] be a blow to Sarah Palin, because Sarah Palin has been a champion for the conservative cause, and if she was going to endorse Donald Trump, sadly, she would be endorsing someone who’s held progressive views all their life on the sanctity of life, on marriage, on   abortion,” Cruz campaign spokesman Rick Tyler said on CNN’s “New Day. ” Bristol Palin responded directly to Cruz: “I would not be in the U.

101,101,20165,123627,184492,Trump high court pick Gorsuch shows conservative credentials,Reuters,Lawrence Hurley and Andrew Chung,2017-06-27,2017.0,6.0,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-gorsuch-idUSKBN19H2PS  ," In less than three months, President Donald Trump’s nominee to the U. S. Supreme Court, Justice Neil Gorsuch, is already staking out ground on the court’s right, adding his voice to the biggest controversies including Trump’s travel ban targeted at six   countries, gun control, religious rights and gay rights. In a flurry of activity at the court on Monday, Gorsuch showed his inclination to rule from a spot occupied by fellow conservative Justice Clarence Thomas. At a minimum, he is so far living up to Trump’s claim that he would be a conservative in the mold of the man he replaced, Justice Antonin Scalia, who died last year. Thomas, appointed by President George H. W. Bush in 1991, is seen by legal experts as the most conservative of the nine justices and is known for his idiosyncratic views of some legal issues. The court has a   conservative majority. Two of the conservative majority, Anthony Kennedy, and to a lesser extent Chief Justice John Roberts, sometimes side with the liberals. Liberal groups and Democratic senators had vociferously opposed Gorsuch’s appointment, with the evidence so far suggesting their depiction of him as a dogged conservative was largely correct. ”Justice Gorsuch has shown himself to be the conservative ideologue many predicted he would be and not the moderating check on the executive branch as others suggested he would be,” said Michele Jawando, a lawyer with the liberal Center for American Progress. Conservatives, meanwhile, are delighted. Their hope that Gorsuch, 49, would be a solid vote on the right, would appear to be well founded. ”Gorsuch is rapidly becoming my favorite justice,” said Ilya Shapiro, a lawyer with the libertarian Cato Institute. The new justice, formerly an appeals court judge in Colorado, was sworn in on April 10 after Democrats made a concerted effort to block his confirmation by the   U. S. Senate. Gorsuch has not been shy to make his voice heard since day one on the bench when, during three   arguments, he sparred with attorneys no fewer than eight times. ”I’m sorry for taking up so much time, I apologize,” he said, smiling, after one such lengthy exchange. Gorsuch has asserted himself on paper as well. His one opinion for the court, in a case about debt collection, was unanimous. But it’s not unusual for new justices to be assigned a first opinion to write where the court is in broad agreement. In the cases where the court has been divided, he has reliably stuck with the conservative wing while showing something of an independent streak similar to Thomas. Gorusch nailed his colors to the mast in a series of written opinions and votes on Monday. In the biggest dispute before the justices, the court handed a partial win to Trump by partly reviving his travel ban that he has said is needed for security reasons but opponents criticize as discriminatory. The ban was blocked by lower courts and the high court agreed to hear oral arguments in its next term starting in October. Gorsuch, with two of the court’s other conservatives, said they would have voted to allow the entire ban to go into effect. When the court also declined to hear what would have been a major gun rights case on whether the constitutional right to keep firearms for   extends outside the home, only two of the nine justices dissented. One was Thomas. The other was Gorsuch. A gay rights case saw a similar pattern, with Thomas, Gorsuch and fellow conservative Samuel Alito the only dissenters as the court threw out an Arkansas court ruling that allowed the state to refuse to list both   spouses on birth certificates. Gorsuch has also showed a willingness to quibble with his colleagues on what might seem minor points. In the court’s big ruling on Monday in a religious rights case, the justices were split   on allowing a church to apply for state funding to   its school playground. Gorsuch wrote a separate concurring opinion, joined by Thomas, in which he explained in part why he agreed with all of the majority opinion, except for one footnote that limited it. ”It could be that he is more similar to Thomas than Scalia. If he continues this pattern it might be significant,” said Ilya Somin, a libertarian law professor at George Mason University.

102,102,7783,7783,26513,Hillary Clinton Struggles to Find Footing in Unusual Race - The New York Times,New York Times,"Amy Chozick, Alexander Burns and Jonathan Martin",2016-11-02,2016.0,11.0,,"Democrats could hardly believe their good fortune last month when it became clear that Hillary Clinton was headed to a general election showdown with Donald J. Trump. Mr. Trump carried so much baggage and had insulted so many voting blocs that some Clinton supporters began to imagine a landslide. But early optimism that this would be an easy race is evaporating. In the corridors of Congress, on airplane shuttles between New York and Washington, at donor gatherings and on conference calls, anxiety is spreading through the Democratic Party that Mrs. Clinton is struggling to find her footing. While she enjoys many demographic advantages heading into the fall, key Democrats say they are growing worried that her campaign has not determined how to combat her unpredictable, often wily Republican rival, to whom criticism seldom sticks and rules of decorum seem not to apply. Mrs. Clinton is pressing ahead with a conventional campaign, echoing the 2012 themes used against the Republican nominee that year, Mitt Romney. But Mr. Trump is running a jarringly different crusade: accusing her husband, former President Bill Clinton, of rape proposing that the country conduct brutal methods of torture and suggesting that South Korea and Japan be permitted to develop nuclear arms. Prominent Democrats say a more provocative approach is needed. “The guy’s a maniac,” John Burton, the chairman of the California Democratic Party, said about Mr. Trump. Referring to a famous 1964 political message, he said, “You could run the old L. B. J. ad against Goldwater, with ‘Three, two, one,’ and a hydrogen bomb blows up with a little girl counting daisies. ” Of course, Mr. Trump faces many hurdles himself, and has stumbled in managing his growing campaign as he shifts toward a general election. But Democrats suggest that the past few weeks have shown that Mrs. Clinton and her aides must become more agile and creative against him. The sense of nervousness crystallized this week when Mrs. Clinton devoted campaign events across California to hitting Mr. Trump for not releasing his tax returns and depicting him as a cold corporate titan who profited off the housing crisis. Such charges helped undermine Mr. Romney four years ago. Yet Mrs. Clinton’s remarks received little   coverage in the news media, while cable channels went live with Mr. Trump’s    recitation of “Crooked Hillary,” his favored nickname for her. Ken Salazar, the former Colorado senator who has been mentioned as a possible Clinton running mate, said the campaign should draw a sharp contrast between Mr. Trump’s shortcomings and Mrs. Clinton’s potential to be “the most qualified person to be president in our lifetime. ” “The campaign needs to expose Donald Trump as the opposite  —   selfish, egomaniac, divisive and unqualified to be president,” Mr. Salazar said in an email. Jennifer Palmieri, a spokeswoman for the Clinton campaign, said that the news coverage Mr. Trump is receiving is not helping him. She said that unlike Mr. Trump, who uses “nothing but his own mouth,” Mrs. Clinton has a campaign that employs many methods of communication, including videos, respected surrogates and bilingual outreach. “We hear from friends who think we should act more like Trump or criticize us for sometimes using traditional communications tactics,” she said. “But we don’t think that’s the answer. ” As a candidate, Mrs. Clinton is not without her own issues to overcome, including her inability to quickly put away Senator Bernie Sanders and her use of a private email server when she was secretary of state, feeding a perception she is not trustworthy. In a report delivered this past week to Congress, the State Department’s inspector general strongly criticized her for the practice. But it is the campaign’s approach to Mr. Trump that is making even Mrs. Clinton’s most loyal supporters uneasy. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York is concerned that she lacks a comprehensive strategy to confront Mr. Trump, and has told Democrats that the Clinton campaign must bring on a senior staff member dedicated only to the Trump portfolio. “As soon as she clinches the nomination, we need a   person in the campaign whose sole job is to respond to Trump, almost on an hourly basis,” said Mr. Schumer, who has begun conversations with Clinton officials about who could fill that role. During a conference call this month,   female supporters pressed Mrs. Clinton’s advisers about her message  —   which has as a slogan “Breaking Down Barriers”  —   and whether it needs to shift for the general election. “The message will be broadening,” Karen Finney, a senior adviser, explained, according to a transcript of the call obtained by The New York Times. “But,” she added, leaving some participants perplexed, “breaking down barriers and unity will continue to be part of the theme because Hillary believes we need to come together as a country in many ways. ” Debates have broken out in Mrs. Clinton’s Brooklyn headquarters over the best approach to take. Some advisers worry that by running against Mr. Trump as she would a traditional Republican candidate, Mrs. Clinton is actually making the   star appear more legitimate. This month, when Mr. Trump suggested he would reduce the national debt by negotiating with creditors to accept something less than full payment, economists dismissed the idea as fanciful. Hours later, the Clinton campaign sent out a news release about Mr. Trump’s “risky” idea of defaulting on the national debt with a response from Gene Sperling, formerly a senior economic adviser to both President Obama and Mr. Clinton, condemning the idea. The seriousness of the campaign’s response seemed to elevate a nonsensical proposal. “That is a danger,” said Dan Pfeiffer, a former senior adviser to Mr. Obama. “You have to take the threat of Trump becoming president seriously, but you shouldn’t treat him as a serious person. ” At the same time, Mrs. Clinton’s attempts at poking Mr. Trump have felt tame compared with what he has unleashed. The day after he accused her husband of rape on Fox News this month, she told CNN, “I have concluded he is not qualified to be president. ” Her aides were exuberant that Mrs. Clinton, a cautious candidate who for weeks had demurred when asked if Mr. Trump was up to the job, had finally publicly declared him unfit. But to many Clinton allies, it felt like a tepid tactic from yesteryear. “Sometimes, you get the feeling that they’re in a professional boxing match and he’s in a street fight, and they’re coming in with their gloves on,” said the Rev. Al Sharpton, expressing dismay over the Clinton operation’s apparent lack of appetite for combat. “This is a street fight with a guy with a razor and a broken   bottle,” he added, “and you’ve got to fight him like that. ” Ms. Palmieri said, “Each tactic we use is designed for a particular purpose to either engage the press or reach a certain audience. ” Any aggressive approach by Mrs. Clinton is potentially dangerous, however, because recent polls show she is viewed negatively by a majority of the electorate. The campaign says it intends to go after Mr. Trump more forcefully, particularly on national security and his business record, after June 7, when Mrs. Clinton is expected to officially clinch her party’s nomination. For now, her aides appear to be throwing ideas against a wall to see what sticks, including trying out different monikers after the Democratic National Committee’s “Dangerous Donald” flopped. An internal favorite is “Poor Donald,” with its implication that Mr. Trump, famously defensive about his net worth, is not nearly as wealthy as he lets on. Her advisers also say that a large percentage of voters have not yet paid attention to the details of the race and do not know about Mr. Trump’s business dealings or that he has refused to release his taxes. “It wouldn’t be a general election without some early   from Washington insiders,” said Robby Mook, Mrs. Clinton’s campaign manager. He noted that the campaign had attacked Mr. Trump over the tax returns and for his “demeaning millions of Americans. ” “Our campaign has already shown the resolve to take him on and put him on defense in ways his Republican challengers never could,” Mr. Mook added. William M. Daley, Mr. Obama’s former White House chief of staff, attributed any early shortcomings in taking on Mr. Trump to Mrs. Clinton’s prolonged primary battle against Mr. Sanders. The period between the June 7 contests and the July convention will reshape the race, he said. To that end, Joel Benenson, Mrs. Clinton’s pollster and chief strategist, pointed out that at this stage in the 2008 primary battle against Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Obama led Senator John McCain by only two percentage points. He went on to defeat Mr. McCain by 7. 2 percentage points. It is clear, however, that Democrats are no longer mocking Mr. Trump. Many of them seem determined instead to understand his appeal. In an interview on Friday, Gov. John Hickenlooper of Colorado said he had purchased and begun reading Mr. Trump’s book “The Art of the Deal. ” The governor said he remained confident that Mrs. Clinton would ultimately win, but added that “she has to be careful, because now he has momentum. ”",0,0,0,0,0,0,102

Rice was a guest at the dinner party where the exchange between Powell and Clinton supposedly occurred. [The Rice statement came through her chief of staff at Stanford Univesity, Georgia Godfrey, who stated, “Dr. Rice isn’t doing any media right now. I can tell you, though, that she has no recollection of that conversation either. ”  Powell pushed back against Clinton’s claims in unusually strong language, declaring at an event on Saturday that “her people are trying to pin it on me. ” He also pointed out that Clinton was using her controversial private email server “for a year before I sent her a memo telling her what I did. ” In that memo, Powell discussed using a private account for unclassified correspondence, but he never attempted anything like Clinton’s   strategy of routing all personal and official correspondence, including classified documents, through an unsecured personal mail server. The dinner party Clinton, Powell, and Rice are discussing was hosted by another former Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright, early in Clinton’s time at the State Department. Henry Kissinger was also in attendance. According to   author Joe Conason’s forthcoming book Man of the World: The Further Endeavors of Bill Clinton, as excerpted by the New York Times, each of her predecessors offered Clinton a little advice at this dinner party. Powell supposedly “told her to use her own email, as he had done, except for classified communications, which he had sent and received via a State Department computer. ” Conason wrote that Powell said that “his use of personal email had been transformative for the Department,” which Clinton took as confirmation of her decision, made months previously, “to keep her personal account and use it for most messages. ” As the New York Times points out, the State Department had formulated clear standards that “using a private server in such a manner was neither allowed nor encouraged” due to “significant security risks” by the time Clinton became Secretary of State.",0,0,0,0,0,0,103

"," The president of Talladega College, a historically black institution in Alabama, announced Thursday that the school’s marching band will perform in   Donald Trump’s inaugural parade on Jan. 20 in Washington, DC. Talladega, a private liberal arts school founded in 1867 by former slaves, was the only historically black college or university formally invited to participate in Trump’s inaugural celebrations in Washington, DC. Student and alumni have clashed over the possibility, with petitions both in favor of and against the band’s performance circulating on the internet. “We respect and appreciate how our students and alumni feel about our participation in this parade,” said Talladega College President Billy Hawkins in a press release. “As many of those who chose to participate in the parade have said, we feel the inauguration of a new president is not a political event but a civil ceremony celebrating the transfer of power,” he added. Hampton University President and Talladega College alumnus William Harvey echoed Hawkins in the release, saying that Talladega’s participation “will be a wonderful learning experience for the students in the band. ” “It will be a teachable moment for them to understand the importance of supporting the leader of the free world, despite one’s political viewpoint,” Harvey added. “After all, the reason for being of any college or university should be to promote learning and not to enhance a political agenda. ” The college will now have to raise approximately $60, 000 to cover the expenses of traveling to and performing in the parade. At least one state official has already offered to help. Grady Thornton, a member of the Alabama Republican Executive Committee, told local paper the Anniston Star on Wednesday that he would help Talladega raise the required funds if the college accepted the invitation. “I have access to the contact information to all 400+ members of the Alabama Republican Party,” he said. “I will start the process with a $100. 00 contribution. ” Tera Living, a   student at Talladega who has been vocal about her disapproval of the invitation, told BuzzFeed News Thursday that she is not surprised the administration accepted. “Not for a second did I think they would turn this down,” she said. “It’s embarrassing. ” But Talladega College alumus Christopher Wohl did not expect the school to go through with the decision. “I thought the school had more integrity,” said Wohl, who graduated in the spring of 2016. “With that decision they have shown that they value publicity over the college’s values and safety of their students. ” Another current student noted the irony of Hawkins’ decision given a specific part of the school’s history: The Amistad Murals, which tell the story of a slave revolt that eventually led to the school’s establishment. “It’s ironic because Trump was supported by the KKK and white supremacist groups,” said the student, who asked that their name not be used for security reasons. “Talladega College has underground tunnels that were made for students to go to and from classes so they wouldn’t be killed by the KKK,” the student added.

After learning that the president used email with a pseudonym  —   apparently to try to protect his identity  —   Abedin asked her interrogators if she could keep a copy of the email. The FBI documents don’t reveal if they let Abedin take a copy home with her. Although tens of thousands of Clinton’s emails have been made public since it was revealed she had exclusively used a private email server to conduct official work, emails with the president have been exempt from disclosure. “This exchange strongly suggests Clinton and the president knowingly discussed classified material in an unclassified setting and hence broke the law,” Raj Shah, the research director at the Republican National Committee, told the Post. But a rep for Clinton downplayed the documents significance. “These materials further demonstrate why the Justice Department believed there was no basis to move forward with this case,” spokesman Brian Fallon said. The documents also show IT workers for Platte River Networks  —   the external company that hosted Clinton’s server  —   referred in an internal work ticket to “the Hilary [sic] coverup [sic] operation” when their client asked for changes to email retention and   cleanup. A worker later said the term was a joke. The Trump campaign immediately seized on this, with senior communications advisor Jason Miller saying: “there was a concerted effort to systematically destroy potentially incriminating information. ” “It’s no wonder that at least five individuals tied to the email scandal, including Clinton’s top State Department aide and attorney Cheryl Mills, secured immunity deals from the Obama Justice Department to avoid prosecution,” Miller added, referring to news Friday of additional Clinton aides receiving protection from the FBI so they could speak to authorities.",0,0,0,0,0,0,105

Pols who backed losing candidate Ted Cruz are mounting a   campaign to rig the convention rules. Meanwhile, in Virginia, a state where Trump came in first in the primary, a lawsuit filed Friday by a local   politician claims he and fellow delegates should be free to ignore the will of the voters and follow their own “conscience” when they choose a nominee at the convention. Be prepared for more whining and skulduggery ahead, as an embittered minority of Republican insiders tries to derail Trump’s unorthodox candidacy. This unsavory drama will play out between now and the convention’s start on July 18.  The   contingent is quietly trying to persuade convention   to turn the balloting for presidential nominee into a    never mind the desire of the voters who actually chose Trump. The plotters hope to dump Trump and slip in another candidate. It could be distant   finisher Cruz  —   who still refuses to endorse Trump  —   or   John Kasich, not to mention a   Mitt Romney.

The intrigue isn’t confined to stacking the convention rules against Trump. The saboteurs have gone to court to stop him. Carroll Correll Jr. a   Virginia party regular chosen to be a delegate, is suing to avoid any obligation to vote for Trump in Cleveland. That’s even though he signed a pledge to abide by the results of his state’s primary.  Serving as a delegate is a juicy perk for party insiders and big donors. It’s not the College of Cardinals choosing a pope. Delegates are customarily rubber stamps for the primary voters. Correll is trying to weasel out, claiming his “conscience” bars him from voting for a man he says is “unfit to serve as president. ” But hold on. Why should Correll’s opinion override the decisions of Virginia voters? Correll is twisting the First Amendment, claiming it protects his “right” to follow his whim. Nonsense. If he wants to exercise his conscience, he should just resign as a delegate, stay home and watch Trump accept the nomination on TV. As for Correll’s right to express his own “conscience,” he can yell all he wants at the screen. Worse than Correll’s lawsuit is the   “support” for Trump offered by Republican big shots like Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and House Speaker Paul Ryan. Don’t they realize their waffling risks handing the presidency to Hillary on a silver platter? On Sunday, McConnell refused to say whether Donald Trump is “qualified to be president. ” The senator quickly conceded that “our primary voters have made their decision as to who they want to be the nominee. ”  But he has so little respect for those voters that he’s withholding his own support. That’s precisely the arrogance that drove so many Trump voters to the polls in the first place. McConnell’s only praise for Trump is that he’s started using a teleprompter. Few Americans think we need another totally scripted politician. Trump’s spontaneous style knocked his 16 GOP competitors out of the race. Americans are fed up with canned speeches and political correctness. They want real change. The nation’s economy has been slogging along at under 2 percent growth for nearly a decade. It’s depressing our standard of living and destroying our young people’s dreams of success. Hillary will make it worse, with more regulations, higher taxes and a war on fossil fuels. Trump offers a radical vision for economic resurgence. Don’t let the insiders snatch this chance away from us.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,106

","BOSTON  —   At a rally that had the feel of a campaign event, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren appealed to their supporters Friday as liberals continue to mobilize against the agenda of Republican President Donald Trump. The joint appearance by the senators from Vermont and Massachusetts, respectively, was attended by hundreds of enthusiastic backers at a downtown Boston theater. The two hit familiar themes, including wealth inequality, the need to expand health care, help for a struggling middle class and a $15 per hour minimum wage. Sanders, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats, said that the time is long overdue for a “fundamental restructuring of the Democratic Party. ” He said that Democrats shouldn’t be “a party of the liberal elite, but a party of the working class, a party of the grass roots. ” Sanders also said that he will push legislation that will make public colleges and universities tuition free. Some of the biggest cheers came when he vowed to work to expand Medicare coverage to everyone in the country, essentially creating a guarantee of health care for all. “Don’t tell me in the United States of America that we cannot do it,” Sanders said. Warren, a Democrat, also drew cheers from the crowd when she credited protesters for helping put pressure on Republicans to try to find a replacement for former President Barack Obama’s health care law  —   legislation the GOP has failed to pass. “It didn’t happen because we got out there and fought back,” Warren said. Like Sanders, Warren also touched on economic themes, but she directed a lot of her fire squarely at Trump, even as she urged the crowd to stay focused more on policy than the president’s personality. “The real point is not who Donald Trump is. It’s not what kind of person he is. The real point is what Donald Trump and the Republicans in Congress are doing,” she said. “I grew up in an America which was not perfect, but every day we had a better than 90 percent chance that we would do better than our parents,” Warren added. “That has been ripped away from us. ” Warren and Sanders are among the top voices in the Senate opposed to Trump. Democrats hold few levers of power in Washington, with Republicans in charge of the House, Senate and the White House. The former presidential candidate and Warren are both up for   next year. Earlier Friday, Sanders delivered a speech at the Edward M. Kennedy Institute for the United States Senate, calling Trump a “fraud” and saying his goal was to rally Americans around a more progressive agenda.",0,0,0,0,0,0,108
109,109,23729,127191,190163,Exclusive: Clinton campaign also hacked in attacks on Democrats,Reuters,"Mark Hosenball, Joseph Menn and John Walcott",2016-07-31,2016.0,7.0,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-cyber-democrats-investigation-exc-idUSKCN1092HK  ," A computer network used by Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton’s campaign was hacked as part of a broad cyber attack on Democratic political organizations, people familiar with the matter told Reuters. The latest attack, which was disclosed to Reuters on Friday, follows two other hacks on the Democratic National Committee, or DNC, and the party’s fundraising committee for candidates for the U. S. House of Representatives. A Clinton campaign spokesman said in a statement late on Friday that an analytics data program maintained by the DNC and used by the campaign and a number of other entities ”was accessed as part of the DNC hack.” ”Our campaign computer system has been under review by outside cyber security experts. To date, they have found no evidence that our internal systems have been compromised,” said Clinton campaign spokesman Nick Merrill. Later, a campaign official said hackers had access to the analytics program’s server for approximately five days. The analytics data program is one of many systems the campaign accesses to conduct voter analysis, and does not include social security numbers or credit card numbers, the official said. The U. S. Department of Justice national security division is investigating whether cyber attacks on Democratic political organizations threatened U. S. security, sources familiar with the matter said on Friday. The involvement of the Justice Department’s national security division is a sign that the Obama administration has concluded that the hacking was sponsored by a state, people with knowledge of the investigation said. While it is unclear exactly what material the hackers may have gained access to, the third such attack on sensitive Democratic targets disclosed in the last six weeks has caused alarm in the party and beyond, just over three months before the Nov. 8 U. S. presidential election. Hackers, whom U. S. intelligence officials have concluded were Russian, gained access to the entire network of the fundraising Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, or DCCC, said people familiar with the matter, detailing the extent of the breach to Reuters for the first time. Cyber security experts and U. S. officials said earlier this week they had concluded, based on analysis of malware and other aspects of the DNC hack, that Russia engineered the release of hacked Democratic Party emails to influence the U. S. presidential election. The U. S. Federal Bureau of Investigation said on Friday it was ”aware of media reporting on cyber intrusions involving multiple political entities, and is working to determine the accuracy, nature and scope of these matters.” ”The FBI takes seriously any allegations of intrusions, and we will continue to hold accountable those who pose a threat in cyberspace,” the agency said in an emailed statement. The hack did not involve the private email system Clinton used while she was secretary of state. Yahoo News reported on Thursday night that the FBI had warned the Clinton campaign last March that it was a target of a cyber attack involving spearphishing and had asked the campaign to turn over sensitive data to help in its investigation, but that campaign lawyers rejected this request as too intrusive. A source familiar with the matter confirmed this account to Reuters.  RUSSIAN HACKERS The new disclosure to Reuters that hackers gained access to the full DCCC network means they would have had access to everything on the network from emails to strategy memos and opposition research prepared to support Democratic candidates in campaigns for the House. The hack of the DCCC, which is based in Washington, was reported first by Reuters on Thursday, ahead of Clinton’s speech in Philadelphia accepting the Democratic party’s nomination. Russian officials could not be immediately reached for comment. Several U. S. officials said the Obama administration has avoided publicly attributing the attacks to Russia as that might undermine Secretary of State John Kerry’s effort to win Russian cooperation in the war on Islamic State in Syria. The officials said the administration fears Russian President Vladimir Putin might respond to a public move by escalating cyber attacks on U. S. targets, increasing military harassment of U. S. and allied aircraft and warships in the Baltic and Black Seas, and making more aggressive moves in Eastern Europe. Some officials question the approach, arguing that responding more forcefully to Russia would be more effective than remaining silent. The Obama administration announced in an April 2015 executive order that it could apply economic sanctions in response to cyber attacks.  TRUMP ON EMAILS The hack on the DNC, made public in June, led to WikiLeaks publishing more than 19, 000 emails last weekend, some of them showing favoritism within the DNC for Clinton over U. S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz resigned on Sunday as a result, creating a rocky start for the party’s convention in Philadelphia this week. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump on Wednesday invited Russia to dig up thousands of ”missing” emails from Clinton’s time at the State Department, prompting Democrats to accuse him of urging foreigners to spy on Americans. On Thursday, Trump said his remarks were meant as sarcasm. Earlier in the week, Clinton campaign senior policy adviser Jake Sullivan had criticized Trump and called the hacking ”a national security issue.” Trump campaign spokesman Jason Miller said on Friday the reported breach showed cyber security is ”a problem wherever Hillary Clinton goes. Hopefully this time there wasn’t classified or top secret information that puts American lives at risk.” In Washington, the DCCC said early on Friday it had hired cyber security firm CrowdStrike to investigate. ”We have taken and are continuing to take steps to enhance the security of our network,” the DCCC said. ”We are cooperating with federal law enforcement with respect to their ongoing investigation.” The DCCC had no additional comment late on Friday. Officials at the DNC did not respond to requests for comment.  Senator Dianne Feinstein, a California Democrat and the top Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee, told CNN on Friday she had not heard about the hack of the Clinton campaign. But she said: ”It wouldn’t surprise me. I think it should be pretty clear that both campaigns should be aware that there’s a problem out there. Everybody should be cautious.”  (Additional reporting by Dustin Volz, Susan Cornwell and Emily Stephenson in Washington, Grant Smith in New York and Amanda Becker in Hatfield, Pennsylvania; Editing by Kevin Drawbaugh, Bill Rigby and Mary Milliken) BRUSSELS EU antitrust regulators are weighing another record fine against Google over its Android mobile operating system and have set up a panel of experts to give a second opinion on the case, two people familiar with the matter said.

110,110,26131,26137,44891,Flashback: George Soros Financed Hillary Clinton’s Recount Lawyer Marc Elias,Breitbart,Aaron Klein,2016-11-28,2016.0,11.0,,"The lawyer representing Hillary Clinton’s recount efforts recently led legal battles against state voting laws with an infusion of funding from billionaire George Soros. [On Saturday, Marc Elias, the Clinton team’s general counsel, announced Clinton’s campaign would participate in Green Party candidate Jill Stein’s recount effort in Wisconsin.  Elias also said the Clinton campaign would participate if Stein decides to pursue recounts in Pennsylvania and Michigan.  Elias is a senior lawyer at the Perkins Coie law firm, which also represents Hillary Clinton and the Democratic National Committee. In July, the New York Times reported Soros had pledged up to $5 million for a legal fight led by Elias against what the newspaper characterized as “restrictive voting laws enacted in recent years by   state governments. ” The Times further reported on Elias’   efforts: Elias, who specializes in   issues, was in contact with Mr. Soros in January 2014 when Mr. Elias was exploring a series of federal lawsuits before that year’s midterm election and in advance of the 2016 campaign, according to Mr. Soros’s political adviser, Michael Vachon. (Mr. Elias declined to comment on Friday about the funding of the lawsuits.) The goal is to try to influence voting rules in states where Republican governors and   legislatures have enacted election laws since 2010, and to be ready to intervene if additional measures are passed over the next 17 months. At the time, Soros helped pay for two lawsuits in Ohio and Wisconsin, and the billionaire activist contributed funds for suits that, according to the Times, “Mr. Elias and several other groups filed last year in North Carolina. ” In August, the Washington Post spotlighted the   legal work of Elias in a profile titled, “The crusade of a Democratic superlawyer with   backing. ” The newspaper described Elias as the “  lawyer for Democrats in recount fights and redistricting battles. ” The Post reported on Elias’s top benefactor: With a   commitment from liberal   George Soros, Elias is challenging laws that, he argues, diminish the impact of important Democratic Party constituencies of African Americans, Latinos and young people. “I don’t think people should think we’re done filing lawsuits for this election cycle,” Elias said in a taxicab interview after two flights and a   weather delay delivered him to Phoenix. The Post detailed the evolution of Soros’s financial backing: While Elias will not discuss the funding for his project, Soros’s spokesman Michael Vachon said Elias approached them with a set of proposals for challenging state restrictions that would be helpful “up and down the ballot. ” That was appealing to Soros, who began his political giving with voter mobilization efforts, Vachon said. And they agreed with Elias that there was work to be done beyond what the civil rights groups, to which Soros also contributes, were doing.   …     Soros has given $5 million to the trust that funds the litigation, Vachon said, and Elias said he has picked his shots with an eye toward “protecting the Obama coalition” of African Americans, Latinos and young people. Clinton’s direct involvement through Elias in the recount efforts follows a New York Magazine article by contributing editor Gabriel Sherman last week first revealing that Clinton’s campaign had been urged by “a group of prominent computer scientists and election lawyers” to call a recount in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania. “The group, which includes   attorney John Bonifaz and J. Alex Halderman, the director of the University of Michigan Center for Computer Security and Society, believes they’ve found persuasive evidence that results in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania may have been manipulated or hacked,” Sherman reported. Bonifaz is the founder of the National Voting Rights Institute (NVRI) where he also served as General Counsel. The NRVI’s website documents it is the recipient of “generous foundation and institutional support” from 24 past and present grantors, including Soros’s Open Society Institute. The NRVI is also funded by the   Tides Foundation, and the Joyce Foundation, which has partnered with the Open Society Foundations on numerous projects.  President Obama served as a paid board member of the Joyce Foundation for eight years from 1994 to 2002.  Joyce has also been a prominent donor to the   Media Matters For America progressive activist group. It is worth noting that from 2012 to 2014, New York Magazine’s Sherman was the Bernard L. Schwartz Fellow at New America, a   that, like the NRVI, received funding from Soros’s Open Society Foundations and the Joyce Foundation in addition to scores of other liberal groups.  Another New America donor is the Jennifer and Jonathan Allan Soros Foundation.  Jonathan is George Soros’s son. New America describes itself as “renewing American politics, prosperity, and purpose in the Digital Age. We generate big ideas, bridge the gap between technology and policy, and curate broad public conversation. ” The recount efforts jumpstarted after Jill Stein at the last minute last Friday filed a petition for a recount in Wisconsin. According to Politico, Stein was prompted by Sherman’s article: Stein first set a goal to raise $2. 5 million to fund a recount in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania based off a report from New York Magazine that said prominent cybersecurity experts were urging Hillary Clinton’s campaign to contest the results there, citing suspicious results.

Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. President Trump stood by his wiretapping claim at a news conference with Angela Merkel. The background: On Thursday, his top spokesman, Sean Spicer, had repeated an unverified claim that Britain’s spy agency monitored Mr. Trump during the campaign at the behest of President Barack Obama. The British were furious, but Mr. Trump made clear that he saw no reason to apologize. During the Obama years, Ms. Merkel, the German leader, had been angered by reports that the U. S. had tapped her phone. Turning to her at the White House on Friday, Mr. Trump said, “At least we have something in common, perhaps. ” _____ 2. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said for the first time that the Trump administration might take   action if North Korea’s nuclear threat reached an unacceptable level. During a visit to South Korea, Mr. Tillerson ruled out negotiations with the North over its nuclear and missile programs. Whether he takes a hard line with China  —   where he is headed next  —   over its support for North Korea will be closely watched, as will be the response of China. _____ 3. More grim developments in Syria and Yemen: In Syria, the country’s armed forces fired missiles at Israeli warplanes near Palmyra, in what appeared to be the most serious clash between the two militaries in years. The U. S. military denied reports that it had bombed a Syrian mosque, but confirmed that a nearby building was struck. A human rights group said 42 people were killed. Above, the volunteer rescue group the White Helmets dug through the rubble. Off the coast of Yemen, more than 30 Somali migrants were killed when a military helicopter opened fire on their boat. Yemeni officials blamed a   military coalition for the attack. _____ 4. As a Marine sergeant, James LaPorta once led an intelligence team in Afghanistan. Now, as a private citizen, he is tracking the moves of a Facebook group that has been secretly compiling and sharing nude photos of hundreds of women in the Marine Corps. “The Marine Corps can’t do this alone. The internet is too huge,” Mr. LaPorta said. “We need to police ourselves. ” _____ 5. The Nobel laureate Derek Walcott died at 87. His poetry captured the beauty of the Caribbean and the harsh legacy of colonialism. Here are some lines from his work: _____ 6. A new heart drug could be a   but it comes with a high price: $14, 523 a year. Those who took the drug Repatha were significantly less likely to have heart attacks or strokes, researchers found in a new study. The drug, manufactured by Amgen, has the potential to help millions of Americans with heart disease, which is the nation’s leading killer. Robert Johnson, above with his daughters, says he feels “much safer” taking the drug. His father died of a heart attack at 42. _____ 7. Our personal finance writer delves into our nation’s maddeningly complex system of financial aid for higher education. His conclusion: “If you have a child who is already walking and talking and you will not be able to write a check to pay tuition, it’s best to start studying up on it now or finding a political candidate to support who will blow it all up. ” _____ 8. We explored the beautiful, eerie world beneath the ice in northern Quebec to hunt for fresh mussels. In the coldest months of the year, when the ice is thickest and unusually large tides empty the bay under it, some Inuit people venture into the luminous ice caves. The mussels, a welcome winter treat these days, were at one time a lifesaving source of food. _____ 9. Happy St. Patrick’s Day. We assembled a collection of recipes you might want to explore this weekend, including traditional fare like corned beef, Guinness pie and soda bread. And then there are some green dishes that don’t require food coloring, like the Green Goddess dressing of herbs, garlic and anchovies above. _____ 10. Finally, what to watch this weekend? Here are some ideas: the movies that influenced “Get Out” new original content on Amazon and the N. C. A. A. tournament. “Beauty and the Beast” also opens in theaters. Jimmy Kimmel used his   for the new movie to take another swipe at the president. Have a great weekend. _____ Photographs may appear out of order for some readers.

112,112,22803,76215,116397,Will Trump Confront Renewed Religious Repression in Russia?,National Review,Elizabeth A. Clark,2017-05-05,2017.0,5.0,"http://www.nationalreview.com/article/447363/jehovahs-witnesses-russia-will-trump-confront-ban
","On April 20, the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation banned Jehovah’s Witnesses, a pacifist religious organization it designated “extremist. ” The more than 170, 000 Jehovah’s Witnesses in Russia can no longer meet without fear of jail, and all church properties will be confiscated. Russia has effectively outlawed an entire religion. President Trump should raise the ban with Putin and take other diplomatic action against it. 	It is the culmination of several years of   government harassment including audits, planted evidence, disruption of religious services, and prosecutions of local organizations. The nationwide ban on the denomination revisits the scale of   religious persecution, when Jehovah’s Witnesses and others were loaded into cattle cars en masse and exiled to Siberia. 	The    extremism law, designed as a response to violent attacks by religious individuals on the state, has now come full circle, permitting an attack by the state on a   religious group. 	How did we get here? Religious discrimination and persecution have been on the rise under Vladimir Putin’s rule. He has brazenly used religion in service of his nationalism as early as 2000, when his government adopted a policy paper on national security with a chapter on “spiritual security. ” There it was warned that “foreign sectarian communities such as the Jehovah’s Witnesses . . . under the cover of religion establish extensive governing structures which they use for gathering   economic, military, and other information about ongoing events in Russia, indoctrinate the citizens and incite separatist tendencies. ” 	Russia even started a major international row with India in 2012 when a court examined whether The   As It Is, a Hare Krishna text, should be banned as extremist. After this law was turned on the Bible and quotes from the Koran, however, the Russian government swiftly passed an amendment prohibiting any ban of the scriptures of the “historical” Russian religions of Orthodoxy, Islam, Judaism, and Buddhism. 	More than any other religious minority, Jehovah’s Witnesses have been in the crosshairs of Russian security forces, even in Soviet times. Jehovah’s Witnesses in the Soviet Union numbered below 2, 000 at the time of World War II, but their rapid increase after the war led to KGB paranoia about their power and spread. In The Sword and the Shield (2000) a fascinating account of a treasure trove of highly confidential KGB documents, smuggled out daily over twelve years by a secret dissident working in the KGB archive, the authors note that “the Jehovist obsession of senior KGB officers was, perhaps, the supreme example of their lack of any sense of proportion when dealing with the most insignificant forms of dissent. ” 	So it is today. And yet Washington does nothing. Two weeks have passed and the only response is an acting State Department spokesman expressing “extreme concern” in an   to U. S. News  World Report. Contrast that with the response of the independent U. S. Commission on International Religious Freedom, which has denounced the ban as a “politicized assault on a religious group,” or of Angela Merkel, who has spoken to Putin directly on the issue. By not speaking out personally on the worst   religious persecution, President Trump and Vice President Pence feed speculation about their ties to Russia and fail those who value freedom of religion and speech. Trump can demonstrate that he is not beholden to Russia only by mobilizing on behalf of the Jehovah’s Witnesses the same pressure that he used to obtain the release of the aid worker Aya Hijazi. 	The ban poses a threat “to individual freedom in general in the Russian Federation,” according to a joint statement by the U. N. Special Rapporteurs for Freedom of Expression, Association, and Religion. Russia’s “use of   legislation in this way to confine freedom of opinion . . . to that which is   . . . signals a dark future for all religious freedom in Russia. ” Through the ban, as a lawyer for the Witnesses argued in his closing statement, “the country successfully acquires 170, 000 prisoners of conscience. ” READ MORE:Religious Liberty Isn’t a Government PrivilegeIn Jakarta, a Key Test of Tolerance Looms for the Muslim WorldThomas Becket and Religious Freedom in the 12th Century  —   and in the 21st,  —   Elizabeth A.

115,115,38911,40303,59170,Trump picks Haley to be US ambassador to UN,CNN,Eugene Scott,2016-11-23,2016.0,11.0,," (CNN)  Donald Trump has picked South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley to be the US ambassador to the United Nations, the transition team announced Wednesday.  Haley, who is the daughter of Indian immigrants, has already carved out a legacy for herself, serving as her home state’s first female and first minority governor. Once considered a potential vice president pick, Trump’s tapping of Haley, 44, further raises the profile of a rising star in a party whose leaders are increasingly attempting to attract more minorities and women. In a statement released Wednesday, Haley said the US ”faces enormous challenges” both at home and internationally. She cited a ”sense of duty” in accepting Trump’s offer.  ”When the President believes you have a major contribution to make to the welfare of our nation, and to our nation’s standing in the world, that is a calling that is important to heed,” Haley said. ”The second is a satisfaction with all that we have achieved in our state in the last six years and the knowledge that we are on a very strong footing.” Haley was also among those being considered by Trump for secretary of state. Her pick leaves former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani and a handful of others among those still in the running for the top diplomat position.  RELATED: Who could be in Trump’s Cabinet? Haley will keep serving as governor until the Senate confirms her nomination.  ”We still have much to do in South Carolina, and my commitment to the people of our state will always remain unbreakable, both while I continue to hold this office, and thereafter,” she said in a statement. Haley’s relationship with Trump: It’s complicated, While on the stump during the campaign, Haley vocally disavowed Trump, appearing publicly on behalf of Marco Rubio and endorsing Sen. Ted Cruz after the Florida senator dropped out of the GOP primary race.  Relations between Haley and Trump have been far from cordial, with both vaulting verbal jabs at each other during the race for the White House.  Rep. Sean Duffy said Wednesday that the fact that Trump is even considering Haley after her criticism of the   speaks highly of him. ”I think it’s quite remarkable that he’s looking for talent and not trying to settle old scores,” the Wisconsin Republican told CNN’s Chris Cuomo on ”New Day.” Trump said in January that Haley’s stance on immigration was ”weak” after the South Carolina governor welcomed properly vetted legal immigrants into her state, regardless of race or religion. He also tweeted in March, ”The people of South Carolina are embarrassed by Nikki Haley!” Haley went as far to say that Trump represents ”everything a governor doesn’t want in a president.” ”I want someone who is going to hold Republicans accountable, and I want someone who is going to make a difference, not just for our party but for every person they represent in the country,” she told reporters in February. In a video response to President Barack Obama’s annual State of the Union address, Haley never used Trump’s name, but implied that he would threaten ”the dream that is America” for others. But by October, Haley had switched her position, saying she would vote for Trump even though she was ”not a fan.” But Haley, who once suggested that Trump was among ”the angriest voices,” was jubilant by his election. ”I’m just giddy, and if you talk to any of the governors here, we are so excited at the possibility and the opportunities that are going to be here,” she said after his win. ”The idea that now we can start to really govern    I have never known what it’s like to have a Republican president. I can tell you that the last five years, Washington has been the hardest part of my job,” Haley said. ”This is a new day.” The Charleston Post and Courier newspaper was the first to report Trump’s pick for UN ambassador overnight. Rising Star, The governor has long been a rising star in the GOP and was endorsed by former Republican Gov. Sarah Palin during her gubernatorial run. But Haley came to national    and international    attention following the Charleston church shooting in 2015, where a   white supremacist opened fire on a Bible study group at a predominantly black church, killing nine people. Haley became a highly visible presence in the days following the tragedy    particularly in the highly contentious battle to remove the Confederate Flag from the state Capitol grounds.  ”These grounds are a place that everybody should feel a part of,” she said at the time. ”What I realized now more than ever is people were driving by and felt hurt and pain. No one should feel pain.” She was born in Bamberg, South Carolina, a small town with about 3, 600 people, to Indian immigrants. Growing up Haley helped with bookkeeping at the family clothing store before earning a degree in accounting from Clemson. She went on to marry Michael Haley, a National Guardsman who has served in Afghanistan, before having two children. In the years following the economic downturn, Haley used her business background to brand herself as an advocate for bringing more jobs to a state that has seen many factories leave.  ”She very, very successfully branded herself as the jobs governor,” Scott Huffmon, a political science professor at Winthrop University, has said previously. ”But she kept her conservative credentials by railing against Obamacare and toeing the line on things that conservatives care about. She has been able to keep a foot in both worlds for a while. And now she is breaking away from being simply a Southern to becoming a national Republican.” Despite her accomplishments, Haley is not known for having significant foreign policy experience    something Duffy said was not a major concern. ”She’s a smart woman,” he told CNN. ”I don’t think you need this great history of diplomatic experience to go in the UN and be successful.” ”I think what you want to do is find people who will share your worldview especially when they go and represent you from the administration to the UN or any other post,” Duffy added.",0,0,0,0,0,0,115

","    At the same time   of State Hillary Clinton was storing emails on a personal server in violation of the rules, her department twice received a ”prestigious” award for its   practices    an honor that, in retrospect, has watchdogs scratching their heads.  The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) gave the   Archivist Award to the State Department in 2010 and again in September 2012, toward the end of Clinton’s tenure.  During the 2012 ceremony, NARA Chief Records Officer Paul Wester described the honor, also bestowed upon the Treasury Department, as “prestigious. ”  How did State merit such recognition? According to NARA spokesman John Valceanu, the award was “specifically focused” on its work related to the management of inactive paper records stored in the State Department records center. But at the time both awards were given, Clinton was skirting records rules with her email practices, according to a recent and highly critical inspector general report.  The latest headlines on the 2016 elections from the biggest name in politics. See Latest Coverage → “It is ironic, to say the least, that the National Archives and Records Administration presented awards to the State Department for their   practices while Secretary Clinton was violating the law by using a private email server,” said Alfred J. Lechner, Jr. president of Cause of Action Institute, a public interest law firm suing over department  .  At the beginning of Clinton’s tenure, the department started using State Messaging and Archive Retrieval Toolset (SMART) a system that let employees preserve emails through their department accounts without having to print and file them the   way for   purposes. Clinton chose not to use it. While the Democratic presidential candidate claimed all along that her emails were being captured on the government accounts with which she corresponded, the IG report said that was not an “appropriate method of preserving any such emails that would constitute a Federal record. ” Further, the IG indicated Clinton potentially violated federal law when she left State without handing over her emails. “At a minimum, Secretary Clinton should have surrendered all emails dealing with Department business before leaving government service and, because she did not do so, she did not comply with the Department’s policies that were implemented in accordance with the Federal Records Act,” said the IG report. The report also cited officials affirming that her private email   would not have been approved had she sought permission.  At the time, Clinton campaign spokesman Brian Fallon said the report still showed “how consistent her email practices were with those of other Secretaries and senior officials,” while urging steps to improve  . Though no official had a known   quite like Clinton’s, the IG report did cite former Secretary of State Colin Powell as well for not turning over records when he left.  Lechner, a former judge, has joined with conservative watchdog Judicial Watch to file a lawsuit against U. S. Archivist David S. Ferriero and Secretary of State John Kerry for the alleged failure to carry out statutory obligations to ensure records were preserved. They filed a joint brief on Monday in the U. S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia arguing that some email records from Clinton’s private server have yet to be recovered by the department in accordance with the Federal Records Act (FRA). NARA’s Valceanu says they were in the dark about Clinton’s email practices at the time of the award.  “At that time, NARA was not aware of the use of   email accounts by Secretaries of State, which we only found out about in March 2015, when the New York Times article was published,” he said in a statement to FoxNews. com. NARA was not completely unaware of potential   problems, however, according to an email released by the Archives’ chief counsel.  In a Dec. 11, 2012 email to colleagues, Wester asked for a meeting to talk about concerns that an effort was afoot to take her records to the Clinton Presidential Library in Little Rock, Ark. “Tom heard (or thought he heard) from the Clinton Library Director that there are or may be plans for taking her records from State to Little Rock,” Wester wrote. “Tom then got to asking questions about what we are doing to make sure everyone leaving the Administration does not leave with Federal records. I told him we are aware of the issue and are working on it. ”   ",0,0,0,0,0,0,116

Moreover, he insists that he knows best how to manage it all in the best interests of America. Indeed, Trump has not only proposed slapping a 45 percent tariff on all goods made in China, and massive tariffs on other countries like Japan and Mexico, but he repeatedly declares that he will personally impose punitive taxes on Ford Motor Company if it follows through with plans to build a manufacturing plant in Mexico.  He has also threatened punitive penalties against Apple Inc. if it continues making iPhones in China.  It would seem, like Barack Obama, Trump has his own autocratic pen and phone. Some cheer at these proposals, believing that Trump will, as he puts it, “Make America Great Again” (a campaign slogan lifted directly from the Reagan campaign over thirty years ago).  Of course, these    proclamations and policies are nothing new.  The Progressive Republicans a century ago, including Theodore Roosevelt, William Howard Taft and Herbert Hoover, all embraced them.  Even earlier, they were central to the   People’s Party, which was eventually swallowed by the Democrat Party’s progressive movement.  However, the times of greatest economic growth and progress in America, resulting in the creation of the vast American middle class, grew not from government control and management of the economy by politicians and bureaucrats, but market capitalism.  Perhaps I will delve further into this another day, but back to Donald Trump. While Trump and his surrogates denounce free trade, proclaiming that they stand with and for America’s working men and women, they find it hard to explain away the billionaire’s own practices for most of his business career. As it turns out, Trump has never shown any qualms about using foreign labor, foreign capital and even   companies to service his personal interests and acquire wealth.

","    Donald Trump, in an extensive interview Tuesday, said he does not intend to release his tax returns before the November election    and ruled out accepting public money to finance his campaign for the White House.  Speaking to the Associated Press, Trump cited an ongoing audit of his finances as the reason he does not expect to release his returns before November, but said he will release them after the audit is completed. ”There’s nothing to learn from them,” he said, adding that he doesn’t think the voters are interested. He also ruled out taking public financing for his White House campaign. Doing so would have saved him the task of raising vast sums, but would also limit how much money he could spend fighting the Democratic nominee. He called public financing “inappropriate. ” ”I don’t like the idea of taking taxpayer money to run a campaign. I think it’s inappropriate,” he said. The billionaire also said he wasn’t interested in spending a lot of money on data operations to identify potential voters and to model turnout scenarios.

","Most presidents, before and after holding office, are offered multifarious opportunities to get rich, most of them unimaginable to Americans without access to influential and wealthy concerns. But none have so flagrantly circumvented laws and ethical norms as have Bill and Hillary Clinton, a tandem who in little more than a decade went from   financial want to a net worth likely over $100 million, or even $150 million. The media had been critical of former president Jerry Ford’s schmoozing with Southern California elites, with Ronald Reagan’s brief but lucrative   speaking, and with George W. Bush’s youthful and   windfall profits from his association with the Texas Rangers. And all presidents emeriti   and lobby the rich to donate to their presidential libraries, but with important distinctions. One can argue that Jimmy Carter sought donations to his nonprofit Carter Library and Center out of either ego or a sincere belief in doing good works. The same holds true of the libraries of the Bushes and Reagan. No president, however, sought to create a surrogate nonprofit organization to provide free   travel for the former first family while offering sinecures to veteran operatives between campaigns. The worth of both the Clinton family and the Clinton Foundation (augmented by a recent   drive to raise $250 million for the foundation’s endowment) is truly staggering, and to a great extent accrued from      aggrandizement. Some have suggested that Bill Clinton’s impoverished upbringing accounts for his   ambition to get rich. But he also seized a unique moment in which to do so. Globalization of the early 21st century and a rather new phenomenon of progressive Silicon Valley and Wall Street families’ having fabulous fortunes certainly made the idea of being a multimillionaire many times over hardly embarrassing in the fashion of the old caricatures of the robber barons in the days of J. P. Morgan and John D. Rockefeller. Banking, investment, and high technology seemed a less grubby route to elite financial status than did the old pathways of oil, minerals, agriculture, railroads, steel, and construction. The Clintons discovered that one could become very rich from a host of sources and still be considered quite progressive indeed, liberal pieties both assuaged any guilt about one’s privilege and in a more public manner provided exemption from the logical ramifications of one’s own redistributionist rhetoric. RELATED: How the Clinton Foundation Got Rich off Poor Haitians, Former vice president Al Gore is emblematic of the progressive contradictions in leveraging politics to get rich. After winning the popular vote in 2000 and losing the presidency, he discovered that the road to multimillionaire status was to mouth green and progressive pieties while monetizing his political contacts and celebrity among new networks of the global liberal rich. Fearing that new   taxes of the sort he supported would kick in, Gore then rushed to sell a failed cable station to the often   Al Jazeera, a Middle East media conglomerate funded from the   wealth of the   royal autocracy in Qatar. RELATED: The Dirty Business of the Billary Machine, Again, But Clinton greed was empowered not just by the unique opportunity of being both a former president and a liberal operator in the age of progressive billionaires who sought access and influence. More important, unlike other presidents, Bill Clinton never quite entered emeritus status. Hillary Clinton was no Betty Ford, Nancy Reagan, or Barbara or Laura Bush but, while her husband was still in office, sought a U. S. Senate seat from New York in an undisguised trajectory designed for the 2008 presidential campaign and predicated on the idea that a mature Bill would de facto be back in the Oval Office as well. Indeed, well before Hillary Clinton’s failure in the Democratic primaries in 2008 and her subsequent appointment as secretary of state, the Clintons had found a way to exploit the idea that both of them would return to the White House. That reality gave them access to quid pro quo opportunities, often funneled through a philanthropic foundation, of a sort unknown to any past American president. Most important, the Clintons had long since discovered that public outrage at their impropriety could be dismissed as the empty and vindictive charges of a “vast   conspiracy,” be they allegations of sexual assault or criticisms of Bill’s becoming the   “chancellor” in the history of higher education, hired by private   Laureate University at some $4 million a year. Share article on FacebookshareTweet But if the Clintons’ opportunities for lucre were unique  —   in both what the couple had to sell and the huge resources of those who wished to buy  —   and if they could peddle myths that they were perennial victims of   witch hunts, still, what accounts for their inordinate greed? Why not settle for a fortune of $50 million  —   in Obama’s formulation that “at some point you’ve made enough money”  —   rather than risk the public opprobrium of Bill’s globetrotting shakedowns or Hillary’s efforts to hide personal   that were tangential to her job as secretary of state? Their previous embarrassments, from the mundane to the existential (Whitewater, the Clinton Foundation troubles, writing used underwear off as IRS deductions, the    odds of making a $100, 000 profit in cattle futures from a $1, 000 initial investment, etc.) all reflect a nonstop drive for lucre. RELATED: Clinton Cash Is the Movie Every Voter Should See before the Election, The answer is likely that the Clintons thought of themselves as elites: educated, affluent, worthy of exalted social and cultural status, pillars of Eastern Corridor good taste, and recipients of media adulation. In other words, they sensed that they were entitled to a good life rare for politicians who entered public service without family wealth or prosperous investments and businesses. The Clintons’ quest for riches was probably reinforced by their belief that they deserved some recompense for all their hard work for progressive causes, especially when they realized that thousands in their newfound social circles had access to multiple homes,   travel, and expensive socializing but were no more gifted than they and had hardly sacrificed commensurately for the public good. The Clinton litany of whiny victimization and   reflects that sense of entitlement  —   one not uncommon among academics, journalists, and politicians who believe that those in the business world hardly deserve to enjoy more opulence than do those who are more refined and cultured. In sum, the Clintons left the presidency at a historic moment of globalized wealth creation, especially in fields considered progressive and green. They were unique in that, unlike other retiring first families, who could offer wealthy profiteers little more than nostalgic signed group portraits, they could provide an avenue to the buying of influence in a second Clinton presidency. They felt no shame about their drive for riches, not just because they were liberals who sacrificed for the underprivileged and therefore deserved their belated rewards, but also because they were convinced that, as   elites, they needed a vast fortune commensurate with their sense of  . More Hillary Clinton No, Hillary,   Laws Don’t ‘Suppress’ TurnoutWhy Is Hillary Clinton Comparing Herself to Wonder Woman? The Democrats’ Leftward MarchThere was a final component to the Clinton fortune: Both were shameless. If it was a choice of earning opprobrium for raking in $300, 000 from a   university for a   chat or, a few months after stepping down as secretary of state, earning $225, 000 from Goldman Sachs, Hillary Clinton always chose the money over the chance to skirt embarrassment. For now, the Clintons again have avoided the final wages of the classical sequence of overweening greed (koros) leading to arrogance and disdain (hubris) descending into a sort of recklessness (ate) and ultimately earning divine retribution (nemesis). But the tragedian Sophocles reminds us that for such people there is never   or enough money  —   and thus nemesis is still on the Clinton horizon.  —   Victor Davis Hanson is a classicist and historian at the Hoover Institution, Stanford University, and the author, most recently, of The Savior Generals.

President Donald Trump and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, the German leader claimed that a trade deal between the U. S. and the EU would be like a trade deal between two countries. [Trade was the topic of much of the press conference between the two leaders as President Trump has made the subject one of the pillars of his administration. During the press questions, a reporter from German paper Die Welt asked Ms Merkel if she thought that a trade agreement between the EU and the U. S. would be multilateral or bilateral.  Merkel said and agreement like the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) would be bilateral, indicating that she viewed the European Union as its own country, rather than a federation of countries. “I believe that the president has clearly set out his philosophy as to what trade agreements have to bring about for the American side as well. I personally don’t think that Germany needs to negotiate and not the European Union. “We’ve devolved our competences to the European Union, so the European Union, or rather the commission, negotiates on behalf of the member states,” Merkel said outlining that it is the unelected commission of the EU, whose role it is to be at the table for trade deals. “So that’s not going to prevent us from concluding agreements and indeed this would then qualify as a bilateral agreement between the EU and the United States if we had it,” she added. “The question is will it benefit both countries or not?” she said. President Trump has made it clear that he supports bilateral trade deals over multilateral deals that can often involve a dozen or more countries with different values and different economic interests. One of the president’s first acts after assuming office was to scrap TTIP which, unlike Merkel, he did not believe was bilateral. The view of Angela Merkel, that of   and of a centralised European Union, is being heavily challenged by countries like Hungary who wish to see reform in the union and more emphasis on the individual countries, than the central EU bureaucracy. In April France will start the process of electing a new president and   migration candidate Marine Le Pen has already hit out at Merkel’s philosophy saying that she, like Trump, wants to put her country first and end the experiment of centralised supranational organisations like the EU.  A win for Le Pen would likely strike a huge blow for Merkel and her philosophy.  Follow Chris Tomlinson on Twitter at @TomlinsonCJ or email at ctomlinson@breitbart. com,      ",0,0,0,0,0,0,120

122,122,10598,10598,29334,Sean Spicer Inaccurately Claims Paul Ryan’s Health Care Bill ’Fully’ Repeals Obamacare - Breitbart,Breitbart,Matthew Boyle,2017-03-07,2017.0,3.0,,"White House press secretary Sean Spicer falsely stated that the healthcare bill from House Speaker Paul Ryan represents what will eventually be a full repeal of Obamacare. Yet, the GOP bill —  which has been panned by many conservatives and dubbed “Obamacare 2. 0” —  keeps key elements of Obamacare in place.  When asked about this at a press briefing on Tuesday afternoon by the Washington Examiner’s Sarah Westwood, Spicer inaccurately stated that if this bill were to be signed into law it would constitute a repeal of Obamacare. Repealing Obamacare was a top campaign promise made by President Donald Trump in 2016. “If this is the policy that passes, is President Trump confident in the future that he can say that he fully repealed Obamacare?” Westwood asked Spicer. “Yeah, absolutely, as I mentioned, I mean, the first half of the bill that we put forward repeals it,” Spicer replied. “There are three things, I mean, each phase that we’ve talked about —  phase one, phase two, and phase three —  there’s a repeal and replace aspect with each one. ” Yet, the bill proposed on Monday night certainly does not represent a full repeal of Obamacare. It has been called by conservative critics Obamacare 2. 0 because the bill keeps in place the Obamacare requirements that insurers allow for coverage of   conditions and allows children to stay on their parents’ health care until they’re   . It shifts the individual mandate from being a tax paid to the government to a penalty paid to insurance companies, does not even address the Medicaid issue in states effectively, helps illegal aliens access healthcare in the system, and it does not allow for purchasing of insurance across state lines as Republicans have promised for years —  among many, many other problems. Specifically on the Medicaid front, the Foundation for Government Accountability (FGA) says that the bill “misses the mark” in terms of rolling back the entitlement. FGA said in a release: Freezing enrollment in ObamaCare’s Medicaid expansion is critical to protecting taxpayers and freeing up resources for the truly needy. This is a politically popular solution that would save taxpayers more than $600 billion over the next decade. Unfortunately, the current draft does not stop new states from expanding ObamaCare and does not freeze enrollment in existing expansions. The draft does not even give states the statutory authority to implement their own enrollment freezes. Spicer, reached by phone on Tuesday afternoon, told Breitbart News, “I don’t care” when told this bill does not constitute a full Obamacare repeal.  “I don’t care. Again, that’s your —  that’s not what the president thinks. That’s not what Tom Price thinks. That’s not what Mick Mulvaney thinks. So, say what you will, but that’s the reality of this,” Spicer said. When told that Tom Price, the Health and Human Services Secretary, actually did say the bill was not final —  and described it as a “work in progress” and not a final full repeal of Obamacare —  Spicer agreed with Secretary Price. “Right, it’s going through the process. It goes through regular order,” Spicer said. Spicer added, too, that the issues of things like dealing with Medicaid, the purchasing of insurance across state lines, and more will happen in future phases. “There are three phases to this,” Spicer said. “There are certain things we can do in phase one and certain things we can do in phase two and certain things we can do in phase three. ”",0,0,0,0,0,0,122

At 35 years old, Kushner is half Trump’s age. He is an Orthodox Jew. Trump has been accused over the course of the campaign of trafficking in   themes. Kushner is understated. He shies away from the limelight. Neither of those descriptions attaches to the  . Yet the two men share a trust and a bond that are real. Kushner is reported by several news organizations to be consulting lawyers to determine whether he can take an unpaid role in the new administration.   laws may prevent that. But formal title or no, Kushner will likely have great sway in the Trump White House. MSNBC anchor Steve Kornacki, who covered Kushner’s family while a young political writer in New Jersey and later worked for Jared Kushner at the New York Observer newspaper, says his political rise represents a striking turn in fortunes. ”I don’t even know the words to describe it,” Kornacki marveled on Thursday. Anyone seeking to understand Kushner’s relationship with Trump is pointed to Jared’s relationship with his father, Charles Kushner. (Jared Kushner consents to few interviews and declined NPR’s request through a spokeswoman.) The elder Kushner was a developer who made a fortune in New Jersey real estate. Charles Kushner gave generously to charities, hospitals and universities  —   including $2. 5 million to Harvard, which, according to the journalist and author Daniel Golden, won Jared admission despite his modest academic achievement. Kushner also gave generously to politicians, primarily Democrats. Young Jared was trained to stand before a crowd at fundraisers in the Kushner home and introduce senators by rattling off their accomplishments. The expectation was that Jared would lead and circulate comfortably among business and political elites. In their hometown of Livingston, N. J. his father described his family as the Jewish Kennedys  —   respectable children with a roguish father. Too roguish, as it turned out. A top federal prosecutor caught the elder Kushner in his sights:  . S. Attorney Chris Christie. A grand jury handed up indictments against Kushner for a scheme to entrap his    with a prostitute and then blackmail him by mailing the ensuing videotape to his own sister. The    had been cooperating with a federal investigation into Kushner’s activities. ”Chris Christie’s rise in politics in New Jersey was built in many ways on his takedown of Charles Kushner,” Kornacki says. ”He got national headlines for that prosecution.” Charles Kushner went to jail. Christie would become New Jersey governor. And Jared Kushner, just in his   would assume the mantle of leading his family’s vast holdings while quietly nursing a grievance. The Kushner name had been tarnished, so Jared Kushner decided to rebrand. He made the conscious decision to push east from New Jersey into New York City. He bought the Observer  —   a weekly read faithfully by the city’s elites of media, real estate and finance  —   a move that gave Kushner an entree into that world. In 2007 the family acquired a giant complex on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan for $1. 8 billion. His father, out of jail, was technically on the sidelines. ”They overpaid and probably knowingly overpaid for it,” Kornacki says, ”because it was the exact same idea as the Observer: They wanted something that commanded instant status and recognition.” In 2009, Kushner married Ivanka Trump. She converted to Judaism with her father’s support, and the two men enjoyed a warm rapport. During the campaign, one young Observer writer challenged Kushner in his own pages. Culture reporter Dana Schwartz accused Kushner of giving Trump’s ”most hateful supporters [the] tacit approval [of his Jewish   ].” Referring to a   by Trump during the campaign that featured a photo of Hillary Clinton superimposed over a pile of cash and a   star, Schwartz wrote, ” . .. people can play ignorant, blame the corrupt liberal media for trying to ’get’ Trump, but it takes only a basic knowledge of world history or an understanding of how symbols work to . .. see the subtext.” Trump’s message, ”whether purposeful or inadvertent, was met with cheers by those to whom that star’s message was certainly clear. Mr. Trump’s tweet was seen as a winking promise to this nation’s worst and most hateful individuals,” Schwartz wrote. Kushner responded with his own piece in the Observer. He invoked his grandparents’ experience surviving the Holocaust and vouched for Trump’s lack of bigotry. ”[T]he worst that his detractors can fairly say about him is that he has been careless in   imagery that can be interpreted as offensive,” Kushner wrote. Now Schwartz tells NPR she is if anything more worried, but clings to the hope Kushner will be a moderating force on Trump. Over the months, Trump relied on Kushner’s advice to make changes at the top of the campaign, craft key speeches and think through senior White House appointments. In recent days, Trump’s transition chief lost his responsibilities and standing. That would be Chris Christie  —   the person who put Kushner’s father in federal prison. A campaign spokesperson and Kushner associates have told reporters that Jared Kushner and his family’s history with Christie had nothing to do with his humbling. But then, Jared Kushner always did speak quietly.",0,0,0,0,0,0,123
124,124,30279,133741,201892,What do black people like me have to lose if Trump wins? Everything.,Vox,Dan-el Padilla Peralta,2016/8/30,2016.0,8.0,http://www.vox.com/2016/8/30/12690332/donald-trump-black-voters," ”What the hell do you have to lose?” In the wake of Donald Trump’s most feverish attempt yet to improve his dimming presidential prospects, I’ve been giving some thought to his elegantly worded appeal to black and brown folk. The gist of the marketing pitch: Since black and brown lives are already so miserable, how much worse could they get if Trump were elected president?    ”What do you have to lose? What do you have to lose? You’re living in poverty, your schools are no good. You have no jobs  —   58 percent of your youth is unemployed,” he told the (nearly  ) crowd at a rally in Michigan earlier this month. ”What do you have to lose by trying something new, like Trump?” he asked at Virginia rally. For this formerly undocumented Dominican immigrant who grew up in the ”inner city”  —   a term whose continued use betrays a profoundly oversimplified conception of how and where ethnicity and poverty become entangled and commingled  —   some answers to Trump’s question came into sharp focus during a recent vacation I took with my wife’s family.    It is one of the glories of post —  Loving v. Virginia America (and surely a horror to some Trump supporters) that a black Dominican can marry into a white family. It is a sign of how truly great America already is that amicable coexistence is possible between a black Dominican who #StandsWithHer and those relatives of my wife who support Trump: I am fortunate to have acquired by marriage family members with whom intense but civil disagreement is possible.    Yet even the   conversations sputter to a stop  —   in my case, whenever I try to communicate how calamitous a Trump presidency would be for me and so many other black and brown folk like me. What the hell do I have to lose?  The question comes from the same place of racialized myopia as the words of the   who asserted with absolute conviction that the descendants of slaves should be grateful not to live in the countries from which their ancestors were taken (cue lecture on the geopolitics and longue durée effects of the slave trade).    Trump’s question and my  ’ casual assertion were both curated for presentation in   settings, detached by racial privilege and a lifetime of segregation both de facto and de jure from any need to grapple up close with the experiences of black and brown bodies. How can I explain to my    —   and not so that I can then pat myself on the back for speaking truth to ignorance but that I might have a chance at persuading him  —   that already by securing the Republican nomination Trump poses an existential menace to the future I have spent the better part of my adult life fighting for? It is a future in which my loved ones and all of those who reared and mentored me will be recognized as   citizens deserving of the very best America has to offer, not as restive black and brown folk pathologically inclined to violence who should be pacified with   jobs or beaten into docility by more ”law and order” policing.    It is a future in which civic freedom will be understood not as the unrestricted right to do whatever I can to benefit myself or accumulate possessions for myself but as the responsibility to support and care for others. It is a future in which substantive knowledge will be prized, and political discourse structured around a set of   facts that are derived through science and evaluated through the critical lens of the humanities  —   not around racial hysterics, conspiratorial mud slinging, or the deceitful manipulation of the natural and historical record. It is a future in which the fetishization of the law, the demonization of ”illegals,” and the expansion of the carceral state will give way to a comprehensive and empathetic understanding of where our laws go wrong and how they can be better aligned with ideals of social justice. It is a future in which skin color, ethnicity, immigration status, languages spoken, religion practiced, sexual orientation, or gender identity will never be cited as justifications for discrimination and reprisal. It is a future in which presidential oratory will rise beyond paratactic strings of superlatives or fulminations of invective to acknowledge through its complexity and subtlety of expression the nuances of our world. It is a future in which a mainstream political party and its media apparatus will stop holding up the aggrieved,   blustery white male or the hypersexualized white female as the only two forms of personhood worth indulging.    This is the future on which I have staked years of study and personal struggle. With Trump as president, gone would be any possibility that my president will know what ”systemic oppression” is, or how it is sustained and perpetuated in American society and around the world. Gone would be any expectation that political leadership can model responsible reflection and mourning in the face of tragedy instead of capitalizing on suffering and death to conceal deficits of vision and character. Gone would be any chance of sending my and my wife’s children to fully integrated and   public schools without being forced into complicity with the structure of grossly unequal educational opportunities that wears the mask of ”school choice.” Gone would be any prospect of living wherever I want to live without having to face the obstruction (and worse) of racist landlords, or the aiding and abetting of such landlords by local and federal government policies. And gone would be any hope of living in a United States freed from the murderous fragility of whiteness: a United States capable not only of owning up to the past destruction and   ravages of white supremacy, but of making a concerted effort to rectify, repair, and prevent. So what the hell do I have to lose? Everything.   Padilla Peralta is an assistant professor of classics at Princeton University.

We either hit it head on, or it comes back to haunt us. That’s why a few of us have pressed the president for seven years not to ignore issues of poverty, police abuse and mass unemployment. Barack Obama said it very well, following the shootings of Philando Castile and Alton Sterling, that some communities “have been forgotten by all of us”. And now  —   in Dallas, Baton Rouge, Falcon Heights and beyond  —   this legacy has comes back to haunt the whole country.  Obama and his cheerleaders should take responsibility for being so reluctant to engage with these issues. It’s not a question of interest group or constituencies. Unfortunately for so much of the Obama administration its been a question of “I’m not the president of black people, I’m the president of everyone. ” But this is a question of justice. It’s about being concerned about racism and police brutality. I have deep empathy for brothers and sisters who are shot in the police force. I also have profound empathy for people of color who are shot by the police. I have always believed deliberate killing to be a crime against humanity. Yet, Obama didn’t go to Baton Rouge. He didn’t go to Minneapolis. He flew over their heads to go to Dallas. You can’t do that. His fundamental concern was to speak to the police, that was his priority. When he references the Black Lives Matter movement, it’s to speak to the police. But the people who are struggling have a different perspective. The very notion that Dallas is the paragon of policing is something that needs to be interrogated. The Dallas mayor said we have done nothing wrong, but look at your history. Ask people in southern Dallas about the police. Ask Clinton Allen, an unarmed black man fatally shot by the Dallas police in 2013. I was with his mother, Collette Flanagan, the founder of Mothers Against Police Brutality, last year. Countless people came up and told us about all the struggles black communities are having with the Dallas police. Unfortunately, Obama thrives on being in the middle. He has no backbone to fight for justice. He likes to be above the fray. But for those us us who are in the fray, there is a different sensibility. You have to choose which side you’re on, and he doesn’t want to do that. Fundamentally, he’s not a love warrior. He’s a polished professional. Martin Luther King Jr, Adam Clayton Powell Jr and Ella Baker  —   they were warriors. Obama’s attitude is that of a   and they rarely have solidarity with poor and working people. Whatever solidarity he does offer is just   to suffering but he never makes it a priority to end that suffering. Obama has power right now to enact the recommendations made after Ferguson. Better training, independent civilian oversight boards, body cameras. But he has not used executive orders to push any of these changes through. This November, we need change. Yet we are tied in a choice between Trump, who would be a   catastrophe, and Clinton, a   disaster. That’s why I am supporting Jill Stein. I am with her  —   the only progressive woman in the race  —   because we’ve got to get beyond this   situation. I have a deep love for my brother Bernie Sanders, but I disagree with him on Hillary Clinton. I don’t think she would be an “outstanding president”. Her militarism makes the world a less safe place. Clinton policies of the 1990s generated inequality, mass incarceration, privatization of schools and Wall Street domination. There is also a sense that the Clinton policies helped produce the   populism that we’re seeing now in the country. And we think she’s going to come to the rescue? That’s not going to happen. The American empire is in deep spiritual decline and cultural decay. The levels of wealth inequality and environmental degradation is grotesque. The correct response to this is: tell the truth about what is going on. Bear witness. Be willing to go to jail to fight for justice if need be. When the system is declining, it can bring despair. That’s why Black Lives Matter  —   and all other young people of all colors who are mobilizing  —   is a beautiful thing. We are having a moral and spiritual awakening. It gives us democratic hope. Its not about having hope but being hope. It’s time to move from being spectators, to being actors.",0,0,0,0,0,0,125
126,126,30478,133940,202249,Clinton’s real millennial problem: young Americans are less loyal to Democrats,Vox,Jeff Stein,2016/9/21,2016.0,9.0,http://www.vox.com/2016/9/21/12963334/clinton-millennial-problem," Here’s a question tormenting Democratic officials and liberal pundits as the country hurtles toward Election Day: When did young voters stop liking them?    It was bad enough for them that millennials backed Bernie Sanders in unprecedented numbers over party favorite Hillary Clinton during the presidential primary. But now the kids are flirting with   presidential candidates instead of getting behind Clinton, with a series of new polls showing upward of 40 percent of young voters planning to back Libertarian Gary Johnson or Green Party candidate Jill Stein.  Both the press and Clinton’s campaign have started to pay attention. The Atlantic recently said that millennials “may cost” Clinton the election, while the Daily Beast argued that we should “blame millennials for President Trump. ” Mother Jones’ Kevin Drum blames Bernie Sanders for the alarming trend of young people turning against the Democratic Party, while Mother Jones’ editor Clara Jeffery admitted to hating young people on Twitter:   i have never hated millennials more https:  .  pic. twitter.  —   Clara Jeffery (@ClaraJeffery) September 15, 2016    This is an alarming, disorienting moment for a party used to being the party of the young. The most immediate danger to them is that young voters’ rising third party interest may give Donald Trump a shot at the White House. But it’s also opening up a series of more emotionally charged questions for the  : Weren’t Democrats supposed to be the party of the youth vote? When did they stop winning millennials? And how?    The key to understanding what’s going on here is that Democrats have largely not lost the young voters they once had. Instead, what’s mostly happened is that America has now spawned a different and newer mutation of the millennial strain  —   one formed in its own culture and with its own political genes. Whether this new type of millennial will follow its peers into the Democratic Party may be one of the most important political questions in the election, but  —   aside from largely despising Trump  —   nobody knows exactly where they’ll end up. And that’s giving third parties an opening.    The old millennials versus young millennials “schism”: the key to understanding youth politics The first step to understanding youth voting patterns is to break the youth vote into two separate groups  —   the “old millennials” and the “young millennials. ” These two groups have their own distinct political identities that often gets glossed over in media coverage, according to John Della Volpe, a leading researcher of millennial voting patterns at Harvard’s Institute of Politics.     But Della Volpe says there really is a measurable “millennial schism. ” He suggests we can even put an approximate date on it: Young millennials were born after November 4, 1990, and old millennials were born before that date. (Preemptive apologies here if this makes those reading this feel old.)             This day isn’t chosen at random: It’s the   point for being old enough to vote for President Obama in 2008. The millennials on one side of this divide  —   now aged about 26 to 35  —   have become more reliable Democratic allies. Polling that zeroes in on this age group is scarce, but what we have suggests Clinton will secure close to 50 percent of these older millennials. “Older millennials are supporting Clinton at about the rate you’d expect,” says Drum, of Mother Jones. Then there’s a separate group of younger millennials  —   those now aged 18 to 25. They do not have the same allegiance to the Democratic Party, and their political identity is more fluid, Della Volpe says. Depending on the pollster, this group’s support for Clinton hovers closer to the 35 percent mark when third parties are included.    This intragenerational divide has become increasingly clear over the course of the presidential election. Looking at data from the firm SurveyMonkey last week, FiveThirtyEight’s Harry Enten says that   to    prefer Clinton by a   margin. (That’s the same as Obama’s   margin of victory among millennials in 2012.) By comparison, Clinton holds just a   advantage for among those aged 18 to 24, according to Enten. That may not sound too dramatic, and we should be careful not to overstate it. But the divide between young and old millennials over Clinton is about as great as it is between millennials overall and voters in their 40s. And that, in turn, is a good hint of why it’s so incoherent to lump young and old millennials together as one uniform voting bloc. Young millennials are much more skeptical of the Democratic Party than old millennials  It’s become something of a truism in the media that young voters are much more likely to be Democratic. And that does remain true  —   at least until you get to around the    mark.  Go any younger, however, and the trend begins to reverse itself.  “To me, the most interesting thing about this   millennial divide is that the younger millennials are less likely to be Democratic,” Della Volpe says. This is not the same as saying that the younger millennials are less “liberal. ” Instead, the younger millennials appear to be somewhat less loyal to the Democratic Party  —   a divide that first became clear nationally during the presidential primary, when Bernie Sanders secured a massive 81 percent of those aged 18 to 24. (Clinton consistently performed about 20 points better among old millennials than young millennials throughout various stages of the primary.)     But Della Volpe argues we had evidence of a growing divide even beforehand. He points to earlier signs that younger millennials were less tied to the Democratic Party than their older peers:  In Wisconsin in 2013, Republican Gov. Scott Walker won   to    “outright,” according to Della Volpe. He lost among voters aged 24 to 29 years old. In Virginia in 13, Republican Gov. Ken Cuccinelli won those aged 18 to 24 by 6 points, while voters aged 25 to 29 went to Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe by a   margin. Younger millennials have been less likely to register as Democrats than older millennials. In 2014, they said they were more open to supporting Republican presidential candidates than older millennials. Young millennials have consistently different policy views than older millennials, and are in particularly more conservative on fiscal issues. “They aren’t huge swings, but there still are significant differences,” Della Volpe says.  Some observers have been perplexed that the same young voters who so clearly thrilled to Sanders are now flocking to Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson, who is clearly to the right on economic issues of Hillary Clinton. But this confusion dissipates once you begin seeing young millennials not as strict socialists but as Democratic Party skeptics. Indeed, Boston College political scientist David Hopkins has argued that Sanders excelled because he ran in the primary as an “outsider” candidate  —   not because the primary represented any specific policy referendum. This doesn’t mean Sanders’s youth base was imaginary, or that they didn’t support him because his policy ideas powerfully resonated with them. But it does reinforce researchers’ suspicions that   to    are more politically adrift, seeking a movement or party to grab onto. And for now, at least, Hillary Clinton is not their lifeline. One theory of what’s driving the old millennial vs. young millennial split         The way we name our generations is a bit murky, a combination of what makes sense to academics and what catches fire in the press. The term “millennials,” for one, was coined for a book published in 1987  —   before many millennials were even born.  But there’s no reason these generational titles are particularly useful for understanding voting behavior  —   or that they automatically map onto the lived political experience of Americans.    Unsurprisingly, it turns out they don’t. Della Volpe says that his research points to one obvious reason for this new generational divide among millennials: Younger millennials didn’t develop a “political consciousness” until several years after George W. Bush was out of office.  Political scientists have identified a phenomenon called “generational imprinting”  —   the idea that attachments to parties formed during the late teens turn out to prove remarkably durable for life. This crucial and formative moment for many older millennials was the    2000s  —   the George W. Bush presidency and the ascendancy of Barack Obama  —   which is a distant memory for much of the very youngest cohort in American politics today.  During that time period, Della Volpe says, older millennials were hit by a “perfect storm” of news events to become Democratic Party allies. The Iraq War, the Bush administration’s handling of Hurricane Katrina, the prominent role young people played in powering Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign  —   all helped make them the most reliably Democratic generation in decades.            By contrast, young millennials were often in middle school or early in high school for these events  —   too young for them to have been foundational political experiences. Today’s    voters would have been 10 when Bush left office. Their “generational imprinting” process is still being formed, but so far young millennials have generally come of age to see a Washington, DC, riven by gridlock neither party seems equipped to solve, he says. “These are the folks who weren’t part of the ‘Obama movement,’ and they never developed that distaste for Bush that many of the older millennials did,” Della Volpe says.  Viewed one way, this makes young millennials less aware of the dangers posed by a Republican administration than older millennials. Viewed another, they’ve developed a   understanding that neither major party is equipped to tackle the big problems in American politics.    Where do the young political nomads go?             Della Volpe thinks the GOP could have reversed its long slide with young voters this year had it not nominated someone like Donald Trump, a candidate whose views on race and reputation for xenophobia are toxic to young voters. “This election of 2016 was an incredible opportunity for Republicans to create a relationship with the younger millennials,” Della Volpe. “Trump made sure that relationship was never consummated. ” Where these political nomads find a home instead looks like anyone’s guess. For now, Bernie Sanders is doing his best to make them Democrats. But as the Washington Post’s David Weigel makes clear in a dispatch from the campaign trail, it’s not clear Sanders will be as successful a surrogate as he was as a candidate  —   only a few hundred people have been attending some of the Vermont senator’s rallies in battleground states, for instance. “I don’t think anybody knows whether this is going to work,” Della Volpe says.             So where will the young millennials go? Most stories suggest that they’ll come into the Democratic or Republican folds. But Gary Jacobson, a political scientist who studies generational imprinting at the University of California San Diego, thinks there really might be an opening for a third party. Jacobson suggests imagining a Clinton presidency that suffers a   disaster  —    another recession, a disastrous war, a national security emergency  —   as the GOP hardens its Trumpian rhetoric on immigration and Muslims. That might make both major parties unpalatable to young millennials. By the time 2020 rolls around, the question about the youngest voters might not be whether the youngest voters will vote for a third party. It’ll be which one they support. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,126

S. presidential Democratic nominating contest in Wyoming on Saturday, besting rival Hillary Clinton and adding to a string of recent victories as the two candidates gear up for a crucial matchup in New York. Sanders, a U. S. senator from Vermont, has won seven out of the last eight   Democratic nominating contests, trying to chip away at Clinton’s big lead in the number of delegates needed to secure the party’s nomination. Wyoming’s 14 Democratic delegates   fewer than any other state   are awarded proportionally based on support from individuals participating in the nominating contest.  Early estimates showed that while Sanders won the contest, both he and Clinton would likely receive seven delegates each in the close race, maintaining Clinton’s lead overall. Going into Wyoming, Clinton had more than half of the 2, 383 delegates needed to win the nomination. Sanders trailed her by 250 pledged delegates, those awarded based on the results of the state nominating contests.   Clinton’s lead widens when superdelegates, Democratic leaders who can decide whom to support at the party’s July convention, are included in the tallies. Clinton and Sanders both spent Saturday campaigning in New York, which holds its contest on April 19 and where a total of 291 delegates are up for grabs, more than 10 percent of the tally needed to win the party’s nomination. Sanders’ wife, Jane Sanders, went onstage where he was speaking at a community college in Queens, a borough of New York City, to alert him to Saturday’s victory. ”News bulletin   we just won Wyoming!” Sanders said to cheers. Speaking to reporters after the event, Sanders said he believed he had enough momentum to secure the nomination. ”We are closing very fast,” Sanders said.   Clinton, a former U. S. secretary of state, campaigned in the nearby borough of Brooklyn, where her campaign is based. Clinton represented New York as a U. S. senator and considers the state her home turf. Recent polls have shown Clinton more than 10 points ahead in the state. Tension between the two candidates flared earlier this week in a party race that has typically focused on policies and not personal attacks. The candidates dialed back their criticism of one another on Friday. In Wyoming’s Republican contest last month, U. S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas beat New York billionaire Donald Trump, the party’s  . Cruz is trying to block Trump from receiving enough delegates to win the nomination outright, which would lead to a contested convention in July. A new   poll shows that a third of Trump’s Republican supporters could consider abandoning the party’s candidate if Trump is denied the nomination at a contested convention.

The message continued, “Terror attacks are part of living in big city, says London Mayor Sadiq Khan. ” Mr. Trump, the oldest son of President Trump, was calling attention to an article from September in The Independent, a British newspaper, that described Mr. Khan’s reaction to a bombing then in the Chelsea neighborhood of New York City. Mr. Trump mischaracterized the London mayor’s remarks. Mr. Khan did not describe terrorism as “part of living in a big city,” as if bombings and shootings were an inescapable fact of life. He said that terrorism preparedness, including providing sufficient support to the police, was “part and parcel of living in a great global city. ” “That means being vigilant, having a police force that is in touch with communities it means the security services being ready, but it also means exchanging ideas and best practice,” Mr. Khan said in a video interview published by The Evening Standard, another British paper. (For the record, Mr. Khan did say the victims of the Chelsea bombing were in his “thoughts and prayers. ”) “Nothing is more important to me than keeping Londoners safe,” Mr. Khan added. “I want to be reassured that every single agency and individual involved in protecting our city has the resources and expertise they need to respond in the event that London is attacked. ” On Thursday morning, Mr. Khan said in an interview on CNN that he would not respond to Mr. Trump’s tweet because he had “been doing far more important things over the last 24 hours. ” “What I do know is that the threat level in London and across the country is severe,” he said. “That means an attack is highly likely. I was in New York last year when there was an attack in New York. And terrorists hate the fact that whether it’s New York, whether it’s London, whether it’s Paris, whether its Brussels, whether it’s Istanbul, whether it’s Madrid, we have diverse communities living together peacefully. ” Mr. Trump’s tweet was not well received by Britons, who were still learning details of the attack when he weighed in. On Twitter, Wes Streeting, a member of Parliament from the Labour Party, accused Mr. Trump of capitalizing on the attack in London and called him “a disgrace. ” Ciaran Jenkins, a correspondent for Britain’s Channel 4, asked the president’s son on Twitter if he thought his remarks were “helpful. ” “Did you even read the article before goading London’s Mayor during a live incident?” he wrote. He added, “Headline is based on very first sentence, which if you’d bothered to read it could apply to any major city in the world. Key word: ‘threat.’ ” Mr. Trump declined to elaborate later on Wednesday. “I’m not going to comment on every tweet I send,” he said in an email. Political violence in the United Kingdom is relatively rare. Decades of sectarian violence in Northern Ireland often spilled over, but there had not been a   attack in Britain since 2005, when  more than 50 people died in subway and bus attacks.",0,0,0,0,0,0,130

Well, he will be displaying that affinity once again, when he appears on a   Golf Channel tribute to the legendary golfer, “The Golden Bear,” Jack Nicklaus. [A   golf enthusiast, Trump, who claims to have won several club championships, will join the premier golf network in a salute to arguably the greatest golfer who ever walked the planet.   Bloomberg reports that the program on Nicklaus, titled “Jack,” will air on Sunday, April 9 at 9 p. m. ET. The 45th president of the United States asserts in the special that, “People like Jack, they have a desire to win. They never give up, they never quit. He’s a man that’s led a truly exemplary life his family, his work ethic, his championship status. He’s a very exceptional man. ” During NBCUniversal’s 2016 Summer Press Day, golf’s   record holder for major championships praised Trump, when the New York billionaire was running for the nation’s highest office: “I have known Donald for a long time, through the game of golf. He’s been very supportive of a lot of things I have done. ” Nicklaus added, “I think he’s going to be good in the office, going to do a good job. “But, I’m very supportive of all our presidents. ”",0,0,0,0,0,0,131

Trump joked that in the past he’s heard, “Donald, you have the most beautiful hands. ” Christie, who introduced Trump at the rally, said Clinton is the “biggest politician of all,” charging, “Hillary Clinton, here we come!” “Hillary Clinton does not have the strength or the stamina to be president,” Trump told his supporters, who booed when he mentioned the former Secretary of State’s name. “Hillary cannot make America great. ” He also said Ohio has done well with oil and energy, adding, “Fracking is a great thing. ” “I love Ohio.

133,133,26108,26114,44868,Democrats: We Don’t Care If Hillary Clinton Is Indicted - Breitbart,Breitbart,Alfred S. Regnery,2016-06-03,2016.0,6.0,,"Nearly three out of four Democratic voters think that Hillary Clinton should continue to run for president even if she is indicted, according to a recent Rasmussen poll. [Democrats may be so attuned to Clinton’s lies, scandals, and denials that they are willing to overlook anything, but you do have to wonder if they would object to her serving as President if she were convicted. Maybe not: James Curley, after all, Democrat Mayor of Boston, served the last of his four terms from federal prison in Danbury, Connecticut, which is just a short 30 miles from Chappaqua.  Even more astounding is that 100 percent of Democratic elected officials refuse to even mentions the topic. Not one  —   not even one  —   has raised the question of whether it is appropriate for a presidential candidate who is undergoing a major FBI criminal investigation, who is accused of breaking the rules of a major cabinet office, and who blatantly and publicly lied about it, to continue as the probably Democratic nominee. Interestingly, the same percentage of Congressional Democrats  —   100 percent  —   support sentencing reform legislation that would release thousands of violent offenders from prison. Several commentators have pointed out that when Richard Nixon was undergoing his Watergate problems, when the Senate was questioning the President and his aides about the   Republicans were among his most vocal antagonists. Howard Baker, a senior Republican from Tennessee, did not hesitate put the country before politics when he went about trying to determine the truth about possible illegal activities by the Republican President, famously asking, “what did the President know and when did he know it?” Baker and other Republicans voiced serious objections to Nixon remaining in office, and Barry Goldwater, the 1964 presidential nominee and senior member of the Senate from Arizona went to the Oval Office to ask Nixon to resign. If Democrats are unconcerned about Clinton the candidate, where are they when it comes to thinking about Hillary  —   perish the thought  —   the President? If she is indicted, it will be a legal decision made by the FBI and affirmed by the Attorney General and the President and unaffected by politics, and we can imagine the consequences. But if Clinton is not indicted, it would be based on a political decision, not a legal one. Then, whether or not she were to be elected, speculation, media investigations, leaks and Congressional hearings would never end, trying to answer what crimes were covered up by the Obama Justice Department in order to save her candidacy. She would be hard pressed to survive her presidency, not to mention what sort of example she would serve to the American people and to the rest of the world. It is astounding that no Democrat is willing to put country over politics and simply ask the question whether their party has a problem. They may just be so concerned with maintaining power, that they see Hillary Clinton as the best way of doing so, and that think she will continue to deliver the bacon that they are willing to put up with any of her transgressions to get her elected. It is more likely, however, that it explains the liberal attitude toward the rule of law. The rule of law, after all, is fundamental to a free and constitutional government. It is what is supposed to govern the country, consistently, fairly, without bias and without favoring one person or one group over another, particularly those who are wealthier or more politically connected. And it defines, among much else, the way government officials are supposed to behave. The New York Times wonders whether Donald Trump would be a threat to the rule of law. They would be well advised to wonder about the same thing with Hillary Clinton.",0,0,0,0,0,0,133
134,134,30556,134018,202384,A review of a new Hitler biography is not so subtly all about Trump,Vox,Matthew Yglesias,2016/9/29,2016.0,9.0,http://www.vox.com/2016/9/29/13093316/hitler-trump-review," Michiko Kakutani, the New York Times’s chief book critic, has a very interesting review out this week of volume one of Volker Ullrich’s new   biography of Adolf Hitler.     After a few hundred words of   introduction, she rather abruptly shifts format away from a traditional book review toward simply a   summary of a few key themes and plot points from Ullrich’s narrative. And while she does not explicitly say so, it is impossible to avoid reading it as a deliberate, thinly veiled commentary on Donald Trump. As a pure exercise in writing and   it’s fun and surprisingly effective, but the comparison does not really withstand much scrutiny. Kakutani draws out descriptive tidbits about Hitler that are reminiscent of Trump, while leaving out everything about Hitler that is not reminiscent of Trump. We hear nothing, for example, of Hitler’s experience fighting in World War I or of his years of toiling in political obscurity. Instead, it’s stuff like this:  Hitler was often described as an egomaniac who “only loved himself”  —   a narcissist with a taste for   and what Mr. Ullrich calls a “characteristic fondness for superlatives. ” His manic speeches and penchant for taking    risks raised questions about his capacity for   even his sanity. But Mr. Ullrich underscores Hitler’s shrewdness as a politician  —   with a “keen eye for the strengths and weaknesses of other people” and an ability to “instantaneously analyze and exploit situations. ” Hitler was known, among colleagues, for a “bottomless mendacity” that would later be magnified by a slick propaganda machine that used the latest technology (radio, gramophone records, film) to spread his message. A former finance minister wrote that Hitler “was so thoroughly untruthful that he could no longer recognize the difference between lies and truth” and editors of one edition of “Mein Kampf” described it as a “swamp of lies, distortions, innuendoes,   and real facts. ”     A little while later, she draws an explicit parallel to Trump’s campaign themes:    Hitler increasingly presented himself in messianic terms, promising “to lead Germany to a new era of national greatness,” though he was typically vague about his actual plans. He often harked back to a golden age for the country, Mr. Ullrich says, the better “to paint the present day in hues that were all the darker. Everywhere you looked now, there was only decline and decay. ” And she takes a shot at Republican congressional leaders:    Hitler’s ascension was aided and abetted by the naïveté of domestic adversaries who failed to appreciate his ruthlessness and tenacity, and by foreign statesmen who believed they could control his aggression. Early on, revulsion at Hitler’s style and appearance, Mr. Ullrich writes, led some critics to underestimate the man and his popularity, while others dismissed him as a celebrity, a repellent but fascinating “evening’s entertainment. ” Politicians, for their part, suffered from the delusion that the dominance of traditional conservatives in the cabinet would neutralize the threat of Nazi abuse of power and “fence Hitler in. ” “As far as Hitler’s   wishes were concerned,” Mr. Ullrich observes, “his conservative coalition partners believed either that he was not serious or that they could exert a moderating influence on him. In any case, they were severely mistaken. ” And I’ll leave you with this thought: Hitler’s rise was not inevitable, in Mr. Ullrich’s opinion. There were numerous points at which his ascent might have been derailed, he contends; even as late as January 1933, “it would have been eminently possible to prevent his nomination as Reich chancellor. ” He benefited from a “constellation of crises that he was able to exploit cleverly and unscrupulously”  —   in addition to economic woes and unemployment, there was an “erosion of the political center” and a growing resentment of the elites. The unwillingness of Germany’s political parties to compromise had contributed to a perception of government dysfunction, Mr. Ullrich suggests, and the belief of Hitler supporters that the country needed “a man of iron” who could shake things up. “Why not give the National Socialists a chance?” a prominent banker said of the Nazis. “They seem pretty gutsy to me. ” What this comparison gets right  The important takeaway from Kakutani’s review (I would recommend Henry Ashby Turner’s excellent 1997 book Hitler’s 30 Days to Power as an explication of this view) is that our modern image of Hitler doesn’t reflect how Hitler was seen in the early 1930s.     We know that Hitler set himself up as a tyrant, launched a cataclysmic war, and waged a campaign of genocidal slaughter. But before he was in power, Hitler didn’t look like Hitler  —   he looked like Donald Trump.  In fact, Hitler was seen as a clownish figure who was disliked by the country’s conservative establishment and who was never able to crack 40 percent of the vote. But even though most Germans rejected him, he was a skilled orator and effective populist demagogue who turned out to have a larger mass following than his country’s conservative establishment.  So once Hitler stole their base out from under them, leading establishment conservative politicians decided that they would rather try to ride Hitler’s coattails into office than make common cause with    parties whose policy commitments they despised.  The way they saw it, Hitler’s lack of seriousness made him a better option. To work with the Social Democrats would require meaningful compromises on serious public policy issues. Hitler was more interested in   than policy  —   he could be the showman leader and stage his rallies; they would write the legislation. This strategy worked, and when Hitler took power as chancellor the vast majority of cabinet posts were in the hands of establishment conservatives.  This really is broadly similar to the attitude Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell and other leading Republican Party elected officials have taken toward Trump. They don’t particularly like him, they didn’t want him to be the nominee, and they certainly don’t respect his thinking on public policy. But they see his vacuousness as potentially advantageous: Unlike Hillary Clinton, he’ll sign their bills.     What the comparison gets wrong The problem here is that just because Hitler was a clownish demagogue, it doesn’t follow that every clownish demagogue is the next Hitler.  When you think about it, the whole reason Hitler comparisons stand out is that Hitler is such an extreme historical outlier. Most clownish demagogues don’t become brutal tyrants. Most brutal tyrants don’t start massive world wars.  The most recent  —   as opposed to most famous  —   time a clownish demagogue used electoral politics to seize power in the face of a discredited political establishment and an ineffective and divided opposition was Silvio Berlusconi’s various stints as prime minister of Italy. And the   comparison really seems much closer in a wide variety of ways, ranging from their media savvy and business backgrounds to the oddity of men with famously louche personal lives leading political coalitions grounded in church attendance and cultural traditionalism.  And I think it’s fair to say that Berlusconi was a really bad prime minister. He was corrupt, he damaged the integrity of Italian political institutions, his close relationship with Vladimir Putin undermined the Western alliance, he created a deeply hostile atmosphere for immigrants and people of color in Italy, and Italy’s economic performance was dismal.  It’s a bad enough outcome and a very sensible comparison. But if you say, “I’m worried Trump will be the next Silvio Berlusconi,” that doesn’t mean anything to most people. So the temptation to reach for Hitler comparisons is out there, even though there’s no particular reason to believe in them. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,134

","  CHAMBLEE, Ga.  —   Thousands of voters in the suburbs north of Atlanta grabbed the country’s attention Tuesday as a special congressional election neared its end as a referendum on President Trump. Polls in Georgia’s 6th Congressional District opened at 7 a. m. on a humid morning, with commuters casting ballots with iced coffees in their hands on their way to   centers, office parks and downtown Atlanta. Throughout the afternoon, most polling places remained busy, although torrential rain slowed the lunchtime turnout and there were flash flood warnings from the National Weather Service.  Voting hours were extended by 30 minutes at two polling places where voters experienced delays casting ballots electronically on Wednesday morning. All other polls close at 7 p. m.  Back in Washington, party leaders  —   and Trump  —   were paying close attention to what has become the most expensive House race in history, hoping to make the case by day’s end that they were better positioned to   Trump’s stalled agenda on Capitol Hill  —   or thwart it.       (Peter   Washington Post)   “KAREN HANDEL FOR Congress,” Trump tweeted as day broke Tuesday, touting the Republican candidate and former Georgia secretary of state. “She will fight for lower taxes, great health care strong security  —   a hard worker who will never give up! VOTE TODAY!” Democrats spoke excitedly about Democrat Jon Ossoff, 30, a polished former congressional staffer who has raised more than $23 million and built a devoted   following, all while courting Republicans by bemoaning “wasteful” spending. They see his competitive candidacy in   suburbia as a possible harbinger ahead of next year’s midterm elections, when Democrats need to win 24   seats to reclaim the House majority. The race also could have a more immediate impact on Trump’s priorities. Republicans are laboring to agree on legislation to revise the Affordable Care Act. A GOP win on Tuesday could bring new momentum to their push to pass a bill in the Senate, while a defeat could embolden those who are concerned about the bill to more forcefully oppose it.  [Most Republicans in the Georgia special election are willing to give Trumpcare a chance]  Handel and Ossoff are vying to fill the seat vacated by Tom Price, who held it from 2005 until he joined Trump’s Cabinet this year as health and human services secretary. A record turnout is expected: About 120, 000 people have already voted, according to Georgia officials  —   nearly a quarter of registered voters here. In another early tweet, Trump took a swipe at Ossoff’s centrist positioning and dismissed him as a liberal who “wants to raise your taxes to the highest level and is weak on crime and security, doesn’t even live in district. ” Ossoff lives just outside the district with his fiancee.       (Bastien   Washington Post)   Despite the contest’s national sheen and implications, many voters here said they will make their decision based less on Trump and more on how they view the two candidates, whose salvos have inundated televisions in a clash that has grown bitter and tense. That dynamic could complicate the import that this race will carry beyond Tuesday. Special elections are often seen as instant microcosms of the national mood, but they are not always indicative of coming political waves. Strategists on both sides note that the amount of resources and attention this race has received cannot be replicated across the map. “The likelihood is the margin is going to be one or two points either way, so it is very easy to   the outcome,” said Matt Bennett, senior vice president of the centrist Democratic organization Third Way. “But a   swing in a House vote between November and June  —   that’s a lot. ” In this race, Trump has been everywhere and nowhere. Both contenders have mostly avoided talking about him at length in the final days. Handel has focused on turning out establishment,   Republicans with classic GOP appeals, while Ossoff has talked up his willingness to be a bipartisan voice. “As I’ve gone    for Jon, I’ve been speaking    on issues like health care, not about Trump,” Jennifer Wilson, 52, a school counselor, said as she gathered with fellow volunteers Monday in nearby Roswell for Ossoff’s election eve event. Wilson said Ossoff’s age, as well as GOP attacks on his residency, have been hurdles. “Some people say, ‘Oh, he’s only 30.’ But I tell them that Jon is someone who understands the area,” she said. “He grew up here and wants what they want: to bring   and   jobs to our community. ” On Monday night, Ossoff never mentioned Trump once, even as TV trucks parked outside the shopping center where his campaign office is located and cable channels took the scene live in prime time. Homemade posters on the wall  —   scribbled in thick strokes with the slogan “Humble. Kind. Ready to fight”  —   did not mention Trump, either. Ossoff  —   standing before a raucous crowd of hundreds, his sleeves rolled up  —   spoke passionately about women’s rights, gay rights and the urgency of addressing of climate change. He knocked “those cynics in Washington, D. C. ” “There are people across this district, across this state, across this country who have lost faith,” Ossoff said, his voice quieting. “In this room, right now, is the team that can help to begin to restore that faith. ” Volunteers chanted, “Flip the 6th! Flip the 6th!” and waved blue signs in the air as Ossoff and his fiancee, Alisha Kramer, shook hands as they left. “It’s a huge moment,” Mike Magallenes, 67, said as he looked on. A retired carpenter who lives in San Diego, he flew here over the weekend to offer Ossoff his time and perhaps witness a Democratic upset. “I want to send a message even if that’s not what this is all about,” he said. “It’s got to start somewhere. Win or lose, it’s got to be the start. ” Steve Levine, 60, a salesman from Marietta, said Ossoff’s chances would be tied to turnout in cities such as Chamblee in the district’s southern tier, which is home to many younger and minority voters. “The suburbs of Atlanta are changing dramatically,” Levine said. “Chamblee and other spots have significant Asian and Hispanic communities. They’re full of people who have moved here from all around America. ” Other Democrats worried that the district’s Republican voters would come around on Tuesday, even as Trump’s controversies cause headaches. “Karen is going to get support because this is a place where Fox News is on all the time, whether it’s a doctor’s office or at the gym,” Evelyn   a real estate broker in Roswell, said. “That’s the way it is. ” Her friend, Sandra Jackson, agreed  —   with a caveat. “Is this Fox News land? Of course,” Jackson said. “But I do think there is a hidden Democratic vote out there who won’t talk about it at work but aren’t too happy with Trump or what the Republicans are up to. ” Win or lose, Ossoff’s campaign will provide a frame for an ongoing debate within the Democratic Party as it struggles to find its way back to power, having been shut out in Washington and decimated on the state and local levels. That its candidate in this race is the unseasoned Ossoff is evidence of how thin its ranks have become. On April 18, Ossoff nearly topped the 50 percent threshold that would have given him an outright victory in an   primary field. Falling just short, he has found himself in a runoff against Handel, who has scrambled to consolidate the district’s Republican voters. “We have a great candidate,” Rep. John Lewis ( .) a veteran civil rights leader, said as he campaigned Saturday alongside Ossoff. “Smart, young and just good. ” With Trump’s status as a political outsider who has violated political norms as backdrop, Handel and her supporters have pointedly embraced her experience and welcomed   Republicans such as Price and Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue, a former Georgia governor, as surrogates, knowing that most   and wealthy voters here prize stability over populism or ideological purity. Over the weekend, Handel, who has been active in social conservative circles for years, avoided discussing Trump but knocked Ossoff as someone with “San Francisco” values who identifies with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi ( . ). It was an unsurprising attack meant to rouse regular Republicans but also a sign of her uneasiness with how to align with Trump. At Handel’s final campaign event Monday in Roswell, Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal (R) boasted of having spent 17 years in Congress before becoming governor, the sort of insider trait candidates normally hide these days. Deal said that Ossoff “never had a real job. ” As Deal spoke about how Handel would be the first woman to serve in Georgia’s congressional delegation, he kept returning to her credentials. “We are hungry for qualified, capable women that carry the Republican banner,” Deal said. Handel supporters seemed genuinely puzzled by the attention the 6th District has received, given its decades of support for Republican candidates, going back to Newt Gingrich, who began a long stint in 1978 when he won it while Jimmy Carter was in the White House. Carolyn D. Meadows, a member of the board of the National Rifle Association, has lived in Cobb County her entire life and has been active in conservative politics since she was a “Goldwater Girl” during the 1964 election. “No, we’re not a swing state, and we’re not a swing district,” said Meadows, who brought her granddaughter to Handel’s final event. She added that she started responding to every pollster who called her home out of fear that conservatives who detest pollsters would decline such calls and skew the results, leading to a liberal bent. Rep. Douglas A. Collins ( .) implored Handel supporters to prove what he believes to be the truth about a district that Price held so comfortably for 12 years. “It’s a conservative seat. It’s a conservative seat,” Collins said. While the affluent district has long been solidly red territory  —   Price breezed to a   victory in November  —   it has not been quite as friendly to Trump’s brand of Republicanism. He won it over Hillary Clinton by only one percentage point in November’s general election  —   and lost it to Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.) in the GOP primary. Though the two contenders rarely mention Trump, the national significance of the contest has brought forth a flood of advertising and organization. Spending in the race by the campaigns and outside groups has topped $50 million, making it by far the most expensive House contest in U. S. history. The Congressional Leadership Fund, a super PAC affiliated with House Speaker Paul D. Ryan ( .) has spent more than $7 million on its campaign against Ossoff and launched a field program. The spending and national interference has only fueled tensions. One low point came in the final days of the race, with a super PAC attack ad that showed footage of a bloodied House Majority Whip Steve Scalise ( .) being taken off a baseball field on a stretcher after Wednesday’s shooting in suburban Washington. As the sound of gunshots echoes, a narrator says: “The unhinged left is endorsing and applauding shooting Republicans. When will it stop? It won’t if Jon Ossoff wins on Tuesday. ” Both candidates have denounced the ad. For Trump, the consequences could be immediate Tuesday night, even though some of the race’s twists have little to do with him. Inside the West Wing, Trump and his advisers have paid increasing attention to the race and have been briefed regularly on Handel’s standing in private polls and Republican turnout, according to a White House official. In particular, the official added, strategist Stephen K. Bannon and chief of staff Reince Priebus have been involved in talks about the race and ramifications. A Democratic victory could rattle Senate Republicans as they try to pass legislation to overhaul the nation’s   law by the end of this month. And it would raise questions about whether Trump has retained a strong hold on his party’s base as he turns to other policy ambitions. A Republican victory would be demoralizing for Democrats, especially after they lost recent special elections in Montana and Kansas. “I think this race is a   call to the party and the political arm of the administration to pay attention to what they are doing and not doing that could potentially impact future success for the party at the ballot box,” said former Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele. Associates of Trump  —   who have said he is already furious over the focus on his handling of investigations into Russian meddling in the 2016 election  —   warned that an Ossoff win could spark new rage toward Handel’s campaign and the way the GOP handled the race. “The Trump White House, in that situation, could certainly point to how Handel’s candidacy was always problematic,” said Sam Nunberg, a former Trump campaign adviser. “What was her message? Was she running a local or national race? It has never been clear, and she has a history in Georgia as a  . ”  Michelle Baruchman, Sean Sullivan, Karen Tumulty and Elise Viebeck in Washington contributed to this report.

C. U. S. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump criticized Democrat Hillary Clinton on Thursday over her trade policies, saying she would handle trade deals so badly that the country should ”just cancel the election” and name him the victor.  Speaking to supporters in Toledo, Ohio, Trump said the North American Free Trade Agreement signed by Clinton’s husband, former President Bill Clinton, had led to the outsourcing of thousands of Ohio jobs to Mexico, a practice he vowed to stop if elected president on Nov. 8. ”We should just cancel the election and just give it to Trump, right?” he said. ”What are we even having it for? Her policies are so bad.” Trump said he believed Clinton would seek passage of the   Trans Pacific Partnership, President Barack Obama’s signature Asian trade deal, which she now opposes. Trump’s remarks came as the New York businessman tries to steady rocky poll numbers amid a series of controversies and   wounds.  He has struggled to handle the fallout from the release of a 2005 ”Access Hollywood” video that showed the   TV star talking on an open microphone about groping women and trying to seduce a married woman. The video was taped only months after Trump married his third wife, Melania. Trump said on Thursday it was ”certainly illegal” for NBC to release the tape and he left open the option of seeking legal action against the network after the election. Since the video’s release, a series of women have accused Trump of groping them or kissing them without their consent. Trump has called the allegations ”absolutely false.” The latest RealClearPolitics poll average showed Clinton with a nearly   national lead over Trump, fueled by declining support among women for his candidacy. Trump, without evidence, has blamed his sagging poll numbers on a rigged election, and said the media had fixed the opinion polls in order to inflate Clinton’s numbers. Numerous studies have shown that voter fraud in U. S. elections is very rare, and a number of prominent Republicans have denounced Trump’s claim that the system is unsound. While Trump campaigned in  Ohio, a plane carrying his running mate, Indiana Governor Mike Pence, skidded off the runway after landing at New York City’s LaGuardia Airport on Thursday night. There were no injuries, the Pence campaign said. STUMPING WITH FIRST LADY Clinton on Thursday made her first joint campaign appearance with one of her most powerful supporters, first lady Michelle Obama, at a North Carolina rally to urge young people and women to vote. Clinton, a former first lady who lost the 2008 Democratic nomination to  . S. Senator Barack Obama before becoming his secretary of state, praised Michelle Obama for standing up for the rights of girls and women worldwide, drawing a sharp contrast with her Republican rival. ”I wish I didn’t have to say this. . .. But indeed, dignity and respect for women and girls is also on the ballot in this election,” Clinton told a crowd of about 11, 000. ”And I want to thank our first lady for her eloquent, powerful defense of that basic value.” Michelle Obama’s stinging denunciation of Trump after a leaked 2005 video showed him making lewd remarks and bragging about groping women was seen by many as one of the campaign’s most striking condemnations of the New York businessman. Without naming Trump, Obama took him to task again in North Carolina, asking the crowd which candidate they wanted to represent their daughters from the White House. ”We want a president who takes this job seriously, and has the temperament and maturity to do it well. Someone who is steady. Someone who we can trust with the nuclear codes,” Obama said.  ”I would not be here lying to you: I believe with all of my heart that Hillary Clinton will be that president,” she said. Although Michelle Obama was critical of Clinton during the   2008 Democratic nominating race, any trace of bitterness appeared long behind them. The two women showed an easy rapport. They embraced and smiled. Obama called Clinton ”my girl” and made a point of telling the crowd they were tight. ”If people wonder: Yes, Hillary Clinton is my friend,” she said. Clinton promised to take good care of Obama’s White House vegetable garden if she won and wistfully praised the athletic first lady’s dancing skills. ”One could only hope,” Clinton said. She also lauded Obama’s work for children and military families and in what was perhaps a nod to   she hopes will vote for her in the state, said Obama had faced challenges she had not as a presidential spouse. ”Let’s be real. As our first   first lady, she’s faced pressures I never did, and she’s handled them with pure grace,” Clinton said to applause. Although a sometimes reluctant campaigner, the first lady has thrown herself into the race, and the Clinton campaign has deployed her strategically to increase support among young people and blacks, with whom she is especially popular.

Robby Mook, Hillary Clinton’s former campaign manager, said false or misleading news was ”huge problem” his operation faced, including some evidence that the election meddling came from overseas.  ”Look, Jake, I think there’s a lot of things we need to examine coming out of this election . .. I still think we have to investigate what happened with Russia here. We cannot have foreign, and I would say foreign aggressors here, intervening in our elections.”  He continued: ”The Russian were propagating fake news through Facebook and other outlets, but look, we also had, and this is with all due respect to Kellyanne and her colleagues, look Steve Bannon ran Breitbart News, which was notorious for peddling stories like this.”  Trump has picked Bannon to be a senior adviser in his administration. Bannon is a former executive at Breitbart News, which he’s referred to as ”the platform for the ” a   political movement rife with white nationalist,   and racist ideologies. Conway was also asked by Tapper whether   Trump’s tweet on voter fraud Sunday was presidential behavior.  On Sunday, Trump alleged, without evidence, that ”millions of people” voted illegally for Clinton and otherwise he would have won the popular vote in the 2016 election. This was an unprecedented allegation by a  . ”In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally,” Trump tweeted. Conway said that because he tweeted it, it was presidential behavior.  ”Well he’s   so that’s presidential behavior yes,” she said about the tweet. ”The fact is that this man is now President of the United States and he’s tackling very big issues . .. he is committed to making good on the promises on, frankly, the plans, and he’s going to be focused on that. Not everybody trying to nitpick what he does.”",0,0,0,0,0,0,137

Obama spoke during a news conference after a summit with leaders from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations in Rancho Mirage, Calif. but the first questions from reporters were about filling the empty Supreme Court seat. Obama offered his condolences to the Scalia family and called the judge a ”giant” on the court before reiterating remarks from earlier this week, saying he intended to ”do his job” as president and nominate a replacement. ”The Constitution is pretty clear about what is supposed happen. When there is a vacancy on the Supreme Court, the president is supposed to nominate someone, the Senate is to consider that nomination and either they disapprove of that nominee or that nominee is elevated to the Supreme Court,” he said. ”Historically, this has not been viewed as a question.” Obama characterized the rhetoric from Republicans  —   Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell called for the next president to nominate the replacement and others have said they would refuse to hold a hearing to consider any Obama nomination  —   as ”a measure of how, unfortunately, the venom and rancor in Washington has prevented us from getting basic work done.” ”This would be a good moment for us to rise above that,” Obama said. Obama was also asked about Justice Samuel Alito’s contentious confirmation in 2006. The questioner noted Alito was nominated by President George W. Bush and during the Senate review process, Democrats, including  . Obama, filibustered to block a vote. ”How judicial nominations have evolved over time is not historically the fault of any single party,” Obama said. ”This has become just one more extension of politics.” And, he pointed out, Alito ”is on the bench right now.”",0,0,0,0,0,0,138
139,139,6762,6762,25136,Mormons’ Distaste for Donald Trump Puts Utah Up for Grabs - The New York Times,New York Times,Alan Rappeport,2016-08-10,2016.0,8.0,,"SALT LAKE CITY  —   Donald J. Trump has vowed to turn blue states red in November, but as he continues to rattle Republicans with his combative style and provocative proposals, voters in some of the country’s most conservative strongholds are considering a radical idea: supporting Hillary Clinton. The dilemma posed by this year’s choice of candidates is perhaps most apparent here in Utah, a mountain state that has not backed a Democrat for president since Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964. More than 50 years later, a large Mormon population with a strong distaste for Mr. Trump has left the state up for grabs, and with a substantial Mormon presence spilling into places such as Arizona, Idaho and Nevada, what would normally be a Republican safe zone could be surprisingly competitive. With the Clinton campaign looking to put   states in play, the decision for many Mormon voters in Utah has become agonizing as they digest Mr. Trump’s stances toward Muslims in light of their own history as an   religion, and as his “America First” message repels   Mormons who travel the world on missions and who welcome refugees. “People who normally vote Republican are in a terrible state of ambivalence right now,” said Tim Chambless, a political scientist at the University of Utah. “They are so undecided. They want to vote, but they aren’t sure how to vote. ” The first signs of Mr. Trump’s troubles in Utah date to early March, when Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee and a Mormon who is beloved in the state, gave a speech here warning that Americans were being duped by Mr. Trump. Later that month, Mr. Trump was throttled by Senator Ted Cruz in the state’s caucuses, winning a paltry 14 percent of the vote. In June, two polls showed Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton deadlocked in Utah, making it increasingly plausible that its six electoral votes are really in play. With three months until the election, the Clinton campaign is now considering a possible upset in Utah, the Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson is aggressively wooing disenchanted Republicans, and on Monday word came that Evan McMullin, a Mormon who is a former C. I. A. official opposed to Mr. Trump, was entering the race. Voters such as Angie Melton, who has never voted for a Democrat, are feeling deeply torn. “I’m upset by this turn of events,” Ms. Melton, 41, said as she sat in the shade with her family next to the towering Salt Lake Temple, the center of Mormonism. “I’ve always voted Republican, but my thought has been that she would be less damaging in terms of world politics,” she said, referring to Mrs. Clinton. “It doesn’t mean that I agree with much of anything she says or her as a person,” Ms. Melton added, “but I would rather that she win. ” Such   is common as trepidations about Mr. Trump grow. On substance and style, he evokes an antipathy among many Mormons that is rooted in culture, religion and history. For a religious group that was driven to Utah during the 19th century in the face of persecution, Mr. Trump’s calls for religious tests and a ban on Muslim migration echo a painful past, leaving some wondering if they will be next. “The issue of religious liberty is an important one in the state, and the notion of a religious test for immigration raises deep concerns,” said Chris Karpowitz, a director of Brigham Young University’s Center for the Study of Elections and Democracy. “Mormons are sensitive to issues like this because of their own history. ” Joseph Smith founded the Church of Jesus Christ of   Saints in upstate New York in 1830. Converts, however, were often targeted as heretics for practicing polygamy, believing in scriptures exclusive to Mormonism and saying that their faith was the true restoration of Christianity. Most Mormons were Democrats in the 19th century, Professor Karpowitz notes, because of Republican opposition to polygamy, but they started to move to the right in the 20th century. By the time the 2012 presidential election came around, with Mr. Romney as the candidate, 90 percent of Utah’s Mormons voted Republican. That number is expected to drop significantly this year with Mr. Trump atop the ticket. His shifting positions on social issues, his   views on immigration and his flashy lifestyle clash with Mormon sensibilities that prize humility and charity. And there is his stance against taking in refugees from abroad. “His rhetoric and the church’s rhetoric on refugees could not be more different,” said J. Quin Monson, an author of “Seeking the Promised Land: Mormons and American Politics. ” Mr. Trump’s ascendance has also divided Utah’s lawmakers, with some reluctantly saying they will support the nominee and others showing resistance. Among the holdouts is Senator Mike Lee, a Mormon whose opposition to Mr. Trump stalled in a floor fight at the Republican convention last month. He articulated in a June interview why the candidate was unpopular, pointing to statements that he said reflected religious intolerance. “My state consists of members who were a religious minority church  —   a people who were ordered exterminated by the governor of Missouri in 1839, and statements like that make them nervous,” Mr. Lee said. Facing a tough   fight against a Democrat, Representative Mia Love, a rising Republican star, skipped the party’s convention in Cleveland and gave up her role as a delegate. She has not said if she will vote for Mr. Trump. There have even been some defections. Mark Madsen, a Republican state senator who did attend the convention as a delegate, abandoned the party in frustration in late July and became a Libertarian. Mr. Madsen, who is Mormon, said he thought he was being   into supporting Mr. Trump. “It’s hard to figure out where he is on issues because he’s all over the place,” Mr. Madsen said. “I think he’s frankly boorish and banal. ” Sensing opportunity in the air, Mr. Trump’s opponents are watching Utah closely. The state has a strong libertarian streak, and Mr. Johnson, whose campaign headquarters is in Salt Lake City, has been returning regularly in hopes that he can capitalize on dissatisfaction with Mr. Trump. That he was governor in nearby New Mexico could help his cause, although if he siphons votes away from Mr. Trump, it could benefit Mrs. Clinton. Democrats are also taking Utah seriously. While they realize that their improved chances in the state are not because their nominee has suddenly surged in popularity, the party would be happy to break its losing streak. “This is the first time since the   that a Democratic presidential candidate could win in Utah,” said Peter Corroon, the party’s chairman in the state. “Unfortunately, it’s not because of the Democrat, it’s because of the Republican. ” Nonetheless, the Clinton campaign has staff on the ground in Utah, and it is dispatching former President Bill Clinton to the state for a   event this week. The campaign would not say if Mrs. Clinton would make a trip of her own, but the possibility remains. “There is no doubt that Donald Trump’s offensive rhetoric has made Utah more competitive than before, and we will continue to assess our options in the state,” said Marlon Marshall, the Clinton campaign’s director of state campaigns and political engagement. Young Republican Mormons such as Mary Weidman give Democrats hope. Sitting outside a soda shop in Provo, Ms. Weidman explained that after supporting Mr. Romney four years ago, she would vote for Mrs. Clinton in November. “I think it’s the lesser of two evils,” Ms. Weidman, 27, said, expressing dismay over how Mr. Trump talks about women. “When you think of a leader, he lacks every trait. ” Despite such sentiments, it is risky to count Republicans out. While the Trump campaign had no comment about its strategy, the state Republican Party said that Mr. Trump’s team was up and running in Utah. Longtime conservatives who say they are thinking about voting for Mrs. Clinton could have second thoughts on Election Day. “Republicans at this point are a little unhappy with Trump, but they’re going to vote for him,” said James Evans, the chairman of the state party. That appeared to be the case for Nathan Alder, a    Republican Mormon who goes to Utah Valley University in Orem. “I don’t like Trump, but I probably will vote for him,” Mr. Alder said, explaining that his worries about what he considers Mrs. Clinton’s liberal views narrowly outweighed his fears about Mr. Trump’s temperament. “I am pretty torn. I’m not going to lie. ”",0,0,0,0,0,0,139
140,140,32840,33076,51889,Trump admin sets stage for mass deportations,CNN,Tal Kopan,2017-02-21,2017.0,2.0,,"Washington (CNN) The Department of Homeland Security Tuesday laid out the Trump administration’s plans for aggressive enforcement of immigration laws, including a potentially massive expansion of the number of people detained and deported. But the Trump administration also emphasizes that it is leaving intact the DACA program    President Barack Obama’s protections for   DREAMers    even if the new rules chip away at protections for undocumented migrants overall.  DHS officials told reporters Tuesday that while the guidance memos expand the federal government’s ability to empower state and local law enforcement agencies to perform the functions of immigration officers, no National Guard troops will be deployed to round up immigrants in the US.  The fundamental shift in US policy will likely continue to provoke fear in immigrant communities of a vast expansion of the government’s use of its enforcement powers to potentially deport undocumented immigrants who have lived in their communities for years, and may have family members who are legal US residents or citizens.   DHS officials say the policies mostly enforce existing law and won’t lead to an immediate massive   of undocumented immigrants.  ”We’re not going to start changing this today, it’s not going to start happening tomorrow,” the official said of an expansion of who is eligible for expedited deportation. ”You will not see folks rounded up or anything of the sort.” The memos, which were obtained and reported on by CNN over the weekend, serve to expand upon the orders, which are unrelated to the controversial travel ban currently tied up in the courts and being   by the White House.  The guidance explains how the administration plans to put in place the goals dictated in Trump’s executive orders, including vastly increasing the resources to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Customs and Border Protection, building a wall along the southern border and taking a   position on undocumented immigrants.  DHS officials repeatedly tried to emphasize that the policies are not an expansion of existing law. ”We’re just simply trying to execute what Congress and the President has asked us to do,” an official said. ”We’re going to do so professionally (and) humanely . .. but we are going to execute the laws of the United States.” DACA impact, Language was included explicitly saying Obama’s executive orders protecting young undocumented immigrants brought to the US as children and undocumented parents of US citizens would be an exception to a mandate that ”the Department no longer will exempt classes or categories of removable aliens from potential enforcement.” A DHS official briefing reporters on the orders made note from the top that the policies would not be affected. ”No. 1: None of this affects DACA. No. 2, none of this affects   DACA,” the official said, adding that the latter policy is currently being blocked by the courts either way.  The guidance is still unclear in many respects. It rescinds Obama executive orders besides the deferred action for children and parents of citizens    but notes that only ”to the extent of the conflict” with new guidance, meaning some policies will remain in place. For example, a fact sheet released by the department says that rules keeping churches and schools as   from enforcement actions remain in operation.   Asked about the confusion over which policies do and do not remain in place, an official said, ”There are a lot of internal policies and memoranda and procedures that have to be worked out individually and analyzed by the legal departments. . .. That’s a very deliberate project that will be conducted.” But the official emphasized the ”sensitive locations” policy remains in place, and a second official said the rescinding of previous guidance largely applies for now to policy about prosecutorial discretion.  Through the memos, Kelly expands the government’s immigration enforcement by instructing agencies to implement unused parts of existing law and by clarifying standards for certain protections, which add up to having sweeping implications for the processing of undocumented immigrants in the US.  Broad discretion, While DHS officials stressed that the agency will use its limited resources to target ”criminals,” as Trump has said, they also acknowledged that people who were not targeted for deportation under Obama could be eligible in this administration    giving broad latitude to agents in the field and regional offices to make decisions.  ”The fact that you are not a priority does not exempt you from potential enforcement,” an official said, adding that people with crimes like DUIs and status violations, or noncriminal histories but a final order of removal could be subject to deportation.  The Trump administration has set new enforcement priorities that could apply to virtually every undocumented immigrant in the US    whereas the Obama administration had focused on serious and violent criminals    sending fear through immigrant communities about indiscriminate arrests.   ICE enforcement earlier this month, which netted nearly 700 arrests nationwide, only amplified fears. While similar enforcement actions were conducted under the Obama administration, anecdotes spread of nonthreatening undocumented immigrants being caught up amplified fears.  The memos reinforce giving broad leeway to immigration officers to make immediate decisions about whom to arrest and says officers should begin actions against individuals they meet in the course of their official duties.  The goal is to free immigration officers and law enforcement to make decisions,  after critics of Obama’s policies described them as having their hands tied.  But the administration also explicitly reserves the right to expand and prioritize targets, such as ”against removable aliens who are convicted felons or who are involved in gang activity or drug trafficking.” Changes to use of laws, The new plan vastly grows the number of individuals who can be deported using ”expedited removal” procedures, which affords immigrants almost no court proceedings.  Under the new policy, if someone can’t prove he or she has been living in the US continuously for two years, he or she could now be eligible for expedited removal. Previously, this was limited in practice to people apprehended within 100 miles of the border and who had arrived within the past two weeks.  The memos also make a series of changes as part of ending   ”catch and release,” where undocumented immigrants awaiting court proceedings are granted parole and leave to enter the country pending court dates that can be years in the future.  It places stricter limits on who can be paroled instead of detained, making detention pending court proceedings the default for thousands of immigrants. In an attempt to deal with the potential strain on limited detention resources, Kelly orders a surge in immigration judges and facilities.  More difficult for asylum seekers, Along these lines, the guidance also makes it more difficult to receive asylum protections, a key exception to ”expedited removal” that often lets people stay in the US as they await a final ruling on their eligibility for asylum.  Without explicitly changing the standard for ”credible fear”    the threshold at which asylum seekers are granted permission to continue to pursue court hearings on their asylum claim    the guidance makes clear that asylum officers can use more discretion in determining an individual’s credibility, and use their own knowledge to weigh against what migrants claim about potential persecution or torture back home.  Another change: Once people reach the credible fear point, instead of waiting for their full hearings on asylum in the US, the new guidance makes use of a law that allows   migrants to be sent to Mexico to wait, provided they arrived through Mexico. The change could send potentially tens of thousands of   migrants back over the border, and would largely apply to Central Americans who flee violence, gangs and drug cartels to seek refuge in the US.  DHS will also explore a video conference system to potentially keep these individuals in Mexico even for their court hearing, which could be conducted remotely.  Unaccompanied minors, In further tightening of protections that allow more leniency to certain immigrants, the administration is also looking to limit protections for unaccompanied minors that seek to enter the US.  The executive order notes that in some cases, individuals continued to receive protection as unaccompanied alien children even when they had a parent or guardian living illegally in the US, saying it led to ”abuses” of the system.  Kelly’s memo calls for new guidance to end those ”abuses”    which could restrict the eligibility that was previously given to all minors under 18 who arrived without a parent or guardian in the US able to care for them.

","Trump’s nomination of Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt to lead the Environmental Protection Agency and Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson as secretary of state    along with rumors that he will choose Montana Rep. Ryan Zinke as Interior Secretary    have buoyed the hopes of many energy industry insiders and Alaskan lawmakers who have seen attempts to drill the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge thwarted during President Obama’s time in office. “This is exactly the time we need to start developing the area,” Nick Loris, an energy expert at the Washington D. C.  conservative think tank, the Heritage Foundation, told FoxNews. com. “It will take more of a hurdle given what Obama has done, but it can be undone. ” At the heart of the battle over ANWR  —   a 19   tract of land flanked by the Brooks Range to the south, the Beaufort Sea to the north and Canada’s Yukon province to the east  —   is a section of the refuge called the coastal plain, or section 1002. On one side of the debate: Alaska’s Republican lawmakers and a fossil fuel industry that sees the estimated 7. 7 billion barrels of oil under the coastal plain a boon to the state’s flagging economy that has suffered from low oil prices on the global market and a decline in crude flowing through the   Pipeline. On the other side: Environmental groups and the indigenous Gwich’in people, who consider the coastal plain sacred land and say oil drilling would ruin a fragile habitat for gray wolves, polar bears, porcupine caribou and more than 200 species of migratory birds. “ANWR is a national treasure and an amazing piece of land,” Nicole   the Wilderness Society’s Alaska regional director, told FoxNews. com. “It is not a place where oil and gas development should be allowed. ” The refuge was created in 1980 as part of comprehensive   legislation signed into law by President Jimmy Carter that put more than 100 million federal acres in Alaska under conservation protection. Lawmakers at the time recognized the potential for oil drilling on the coastal plain but they prohibited leasing or other development on the land unless authorized by a future Congress. That is basically where the issue has stood for the past 36 years as Alaskan lawmakers’ and oil industry executives’ advances have been thwarted in Congress. In 1995, the Alaskan delegation inserted a provision opening ANWR to development in a budget reconciliation bill, but the bill was vetoed by President Bill Clinton. In 2005, despite having the Senate, House and White House all in Republican hands, a push to open ANWR was also unsuccessful as a number of moderate Republicans voted against it. Recently  —   as global oil prices have dropped to just more than $50 per barrel  —   oil companies have backed away from pushing to open ANWR and instead focused on their existing projects. Royal Dutch Shell in 2015 indefinitely canceled plans to drill in the Arctic and an oil industry consortium that included Exxon Mobil and BP recently suspended its arctic exploration program in the Beaufort Sea. In the same year, the Obama administration made an official recommendation to Congress to designate 12. 3 million acres of ANWR  —   including the coastal plain  —   as wilderness, the highest level of protection available to public lands and a move, that if approved by Congress, would be the largest ever wilderness designation since Congress passed the Wilderness Act in 1964. Parts of ANWR are already designated as wilderness, but not the coastal plain and Obama’s recommendation would prevent any road or industrial development on the land. “Designating vast areas in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge as Wilderness reflects the significance this landscape holds for America and its wildlife,” outgoing Interior Secretary Sally Jewell said in a statement. “Just like Yosemite or the Grand Canyon, the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is one of our nation’s crown jewels and we have an obligation to preserve this spectacular place for generations to come. ” The   Congress has so far ignored the president’s recommendation and the future of the refuge looks to be decided under the Trump administration  —   an idea that is very appealing to those in the Alaska congressional delegation. “We have been working to advance ANWR for decades now. And we need to have the support of the Congress,” Murkowski told the Alaska Dispatch News on election night. ”But if the numbers continue for us with the Senate and you have a president who has expressed support, I will be chairing the energy committee again, and I am going to look to push that early on. ” A Trump administration and a   Congress, however, doesn’t mean that oil drilling in ANWR is a guarantee. GOP senators need 60 votes to get closure on any legislation allowing drilling in ANWR and to prevent a Democratic filibuster, but there are only 52 Republicans in the Senate. “To open up ANWR you need to get 60 votes, so the question is ‘can you get eight Democrats to vote for it? ’” Robert McNally, the president of the Rapidan Group, an energy consulting firm, and former official in the George W. Bush administration, told FoxNews. com. McNally added: “There may be a push to do it, but it might be better to wait for 2018 and see if they can get a   Congress. ” The other option for Alaskan lawmakers  —   and a scenario that increasingly concerns environmental groups  —   is repeating their move in 1995 and attaching an ANWR provision to a budget reconciliation bill. This only requires 51 votes, cannot be filibustered and, unlike in 1995, won’t face the threat of a veto by a Democratic president. “Republicans may try to put drilling in the Arctic into the budget reconciliation bill,” Athan Manuel, the director of the land protection program at the Sierra Club, told FoxNews. com. “So we have our work cut out for us to win over some Republicans. ” In his remaining time in office, Obama does have one card up his sleeve that could permanently halt any efforts to open ANWR to oil drilling  —   declare the region a national monument. The 1906 Antiquities Act allows presidents to designate monuments as a way to protect natural, cultural or scientific features on certain pieces of land. Since its enactment, 15 presidents have designated more than 150 monuments with Obama using the law 25 times  —   most recently to expand the Papahānaumokuākea Marine Monument in Hawaii. There has been little indication, however, that Obama plans to declare ANWR a monument in his final weeks in office and environmental groups say they are gearing up for a clash with the incoming administration. “We’ve pushed the Obama administration to name the coastal area a national monument, but that probably won’t happen,” Manuel said. “So we’re bracing for a fight. ”   ",0,0,0,0,0,0,141

Buchanan pointed out that the Republicans that abandoned Barry Goldwater in 1964 never went on to rise in the party and that Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan who did support Goldwater despite his landslide defeat, went on to become president. That could be a repeat of history according to Buchanan. “[N]ow I read how moral and great and progressive these guys did who have dumped on Trump and cut him dead,” Buchanan said. “And how they’re going to do really well and they’re the rebuilders of the party  —   I really don’t think so.

John Kasich ( ) and former Gov. Jeb Bush ( ). Buchanan responded by saying “Bush Republicanism” was dead. “I think Bush Republicanism is dead,” he continued. “Its big ideas  —   what were they?

144,144,1747,105206,154200,Doomocracy: the funhouse haunted by Trump and Clinton,Guardian,Alex Rayner,2016-09-22,2016.0,9.0,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/sep/22/doomocracy-art-installation-pedro-reyes-haunted-trump-and-clinton,"The horrors of a haunted house usually end once you push open the final set of black,   doors and step back in the fairground. However, the Mexican artist Pedro Reyes hopes his nightmares remain with visitors long after they have left his immersive 2016 Halloween attraction, opening in New York next month. “Monsters have always been a way to speak about our real fears,” says the   . “Zombies are a fear of poor people Karl Marx talked about capital being like a vampire that stalks the living and Mary Shelley’s Dr Frankenstein is trying to create life, which is exactly what genetic engineers are trying to do today. ” All these bogeymen and more will populate Doomocracy, “a political haunted house” that Reyes is preparing to stage within the vast Brooklyn Army Terminal from 7 October until 6 November in conjunction with the New York   arts organisation Creative Time. Doomocracy’s spooky run will coincide with both Halloween and the 2016 presidential election, and is appropriately pitched somewhere between a carnival attraction, an immersive theatre production and any given hour or two within today’s news cycle. Creative Time’s artistic director, Nato Thompson, describes the venture as “Hieronymus Bosch meets Fox News. It’s holding up a funhouse mirror to society. ” Reyes and Nato hope to offer about   people a night a ghastly, dramatic interactive trip that takes in gun nuts, genetically modified crops, climate change, deadly   chains and, looming over Doomocracy’s entrance, a chimeric effigy that’s part Statue of Liberty, part Trojan Horse, and, in Reyes’ view, entirely the embodiment of American foreign policy. “The USA doesn’t have true representation,” he argues, “and yet they say they’re exporting democracy around the world. ” That may all sound as satirical as it is scary. Nevertheless the artist  —   who has previously staged a   version of a psychiatric sanatorium at different galleries around the world and overseen a programme to repurpose firearms as musical instruments  —   is deeply serious in his examination of fear within today’s political landscape. “These days, politicians are trying to create fear in order to take power,” Reyes says, “so it’s quite an experiment to be dealing with the production of fear and its political uses. ” He is also highly respectful of the funhouse trope, partly because it is so familiar to people who might not necessarily be avid gallery goers. “Pretty much everyone can picture a horror house,” he says. “It will, if you forgive the paradox, deal with political issues in a very democratic way. Everyone can engage with the form. ” Reyes and Thompson are keen to ensure Doomocracy keeps pace with events and have been writing and rewriting the dramatic scenarios to reflect the changing nature of the electoral race. “We’ve been workshopping the scripts today,” says Thompson. “It’s a fluid process. The ground is moving fast this election, it’s hard to keep up. ” Reyes, who visited both commercial haunted houses and guerrilla theatre groups in preparation for the show, also says Doomocracy reflects a general hopelessness within contemporary politics, both in the US and elsewhere. “Why do people vote against their own interests?” Reyes says. “Is it that we have brainwashed people to make the wrong decisions? There’s a feeling in the US that it’s a downer to have to choose between the [presidential] options. But it’s elsewhere too it can be said of Mexico and many other places around the world. Brexit was almost like a democratic, rightwing coup d’état. ” Despite this gloomy view, Doomocracy is still able to engage with some of the norms of campaign fundraising. Its Kickstarter page looks set to reach its goal of $80, 000 by its deadline of 29 September, offering suitably   swag for its pledgers, including Doomocracy pennants and buttons, and “Yes We Can’t” bumper stickers. With all this   pessimism, Reyes’ haunted house looks unlikely to attract many Trump voters. However, Creative Time’s executive director, Katie Hollander, argues that the work doesn’t favour either side. “It’s not a commentary on the candidates, more a commentary on the issues,” she says. Indeed, Reyes hopes to take in wider political issues unlikely to be addressed by either party this election year. “It will deal with mental health, the excessive criminalisation of drug use, and the increasing role of the medical industry as a kind of   drug dealer,” the artist says. “There’ll be stuff on the food industry too, and equity or the lack of social mobility  —   those universal issues, that are experienced in every part of the world. ” While this all may sound nihilistic, Reyes hopes Doomocracy could be liberating too. “Usually my art is more about hope, but on this occasion it is a dark project, and offers more of a space for catharsis,” he says. “After all, Halloween is a moment to go crazy. That is the role of carnival. ” Yet, does he genuinely expect Doomocracy to actually change any visitors’ minds about the issues examined? Won’t most already agree with his position on, say, pharmaceuticals and gun crime? “There will be people who love it, people who hate it, people who feel empowered, and people who feel offended,” says Reyes. “Making art is one way to elaborate and engage with reality. ” And this autumn, at a time when truth seems if not stranger, then at least as spooky as fiction, one route for meaningful political engagement appears to lie through Doomocracy’s funhouse doors.",0,0,0,0,0,0,144

Terry Branstad has been picked for the post of US ambassador to China by   Donald Trump.  Trump spokesperson Jason Miller confirmed that Branstad had accepted the offer on the transition’s daily call with reporters. Miller also said that Branstad will join Trump at his Des Moines rally Thursday, one of the stops on Trump’s ”thank you” tour of rallies in swing states. Miller cited Branstad’s experience in public policy, trade, and agriculture as attributes that led to his selection as Trump’s envoy in Beijing. Branstad, Miller said, ”has a tremendous understanding of China and the Chinese people, and is someone who very much impressed the   not just during their meetings on the campaign trail but also in their meetings after the election.” ”It’s very clear that Gov. Branstad is someone who will represent our country well on the world stage, and we couldn’t be prouder of this selection,” Miller said. Branstad’s ties with China go way back, ’  relationship’ The Trump campaign formally announced the decision in a statement Wednesday afternoon. ”Governor Branstad’s decades of experience in public service and   relationship with President Xi Jinping and other Chinese leaders make him the ideal choice to serve as America’s Ambassador to China,” Trump said in a statement. Branstad is uniquely   to the job, having a close,   relationship with Xi. The two have known each other since 1985, when Xi visited Iowa as a provincial official on a state exchange program during Branstad’s first term as governor, and have maintained a friendship of sorts    Xi met with Branstad during a visit to the US in 2012 as a   on the verge of taking power in China.  At a press conference Wednesday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said Branstad ”is an old friend of the Chinese people, and we welcome his greater contribution to the development of   relations.” Diplomacy, But their warm personal relationship may be soon put to the test. The next ambassador to China will confront a number of   diplomatic challenges in the U. S.  relationship, including growing tensions over the disputed South China Sea, the implementation of the Paris climate change agreement, and the two countries’ economic and trade relationship. Trump has already signaled an aggressive posture toward China, bucking decades of US foreign policy by taking a congratulatory call from the president of Taiwan, and sending a series of bellicose tweets about currency devaluation and tariffs.   ”Did China ask us if it was OK to devalue their currency (making it hard for our companies to compete) heavily tax our products going into their country (the U. S. doesn’t tax them) or to build a massive military complex in the middle of the South China Sea?  I don’t think so!” Trump wrote in a series of tweets on Sunday after China expressed umbrage at his call with the president of Taiwan.  And Branstad has differences of his own with Trump. He was a supporter of the   Partnership trade deal    a major factor in U. S. foreign policy in Asia, and a deal that Trump stridently opposed during his campaign. Branstad has argued that the deal would help workers and farmers in Iowa.  The Iowa governor is also a GOP kingmaker as the   Republican in the crucial first primary state, but he didn’t endorse Trump until May, after the GOP field had cleared. And though he never rescinded his endorsement, Branstad freely criticized Trump during some of his most controversial episodes, such as when he mocked Sen. John McCain for being a prisoner of war, and when the ”Access Hollywood” leaked.",0,0,0,0,0,0,145

","Hillary Clinton is considering shaking up her campaign staff after winning the Iowa caucuses by just a hair’s breadth and polling well behind Sen. Bernie Sanders ( ) for the New Hampshire primary, Politico reported Monday. The six anonymous sources Politico spoke with said that Clinton would be more likely to add new staff members than fire any senior staffers outright in the event of a  . The news site reported that Clinton’s campaign manager, Robbie Mook, has already seen his role expanded from    state ground game management to messaging, too. Clinton addressed the Politico report in an interview with MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow set to air Monday night.  ”I have no idea what they’re talking about or who they are talking to,” she said in a preview of the interview sent to TPM. ”We’re going to take stock but it’s going to be the campaign that I’ve got. I’m very confident in the people that I have. I’m very committed to them they’re committed to doing the best we can.” Chatter about further staffing changes evoke the specter of Clinton’s dysfunctional 2008 presidential campaign, when she replaced campaign manager Patti Solis Doyle with longtime aide Maggie Williams after losing several caucuses and primaries to  . Barack Obama.  The Clinton camp is eager to avoid another public breakup this time around.  As one anonymous Democratic official told Politico: “The Clintons are not happy, and have been letting all of us know that. The idea is that we need a more   message, for the primary  —   but also for the general election too  …     There’s no sense of panic, but there is an urgency to fix these problems right now. ” David Axelrod, the chief strategist for both of Obama’s presidential campaigns, sent out a tweet Monday afternoon that obliquely referenced the Politico report and suggested that Clinton herself may be to blame for the staffing issues.  When the exact same problems crop up in separate campaigns, with different staff, at what point do the principals say, ”Hey, maybe it’s US?”  —   David Axelrod (@davidaxelrod) February 8, 2016,  Clinton is currently polling behind her Democratic opponent in the Granite State.

[“At one point the attorney general had directed me not to call it investigation, but instead to call it a matter, which concerned and confused me,” Comey said.  Comey made his remarks during a Senate hearing, offering testimony about the ongoing investigation into Russia’s attempt to influence the 2016 presidential election and the decision by former President Donald Trump to fire him. He acknowledged during the hearing that there were other reasons why he felt he had to make the statement about Clinton’s investigation, including “one significant” reason, which had to remain classified. He said that Lynch’s meeting on the tarmac with former president Bill Clinton during the campaign was the ultimate reason why he decided to make a public statement when the department decided not to prosecute Hillary Clinton. “In a ultimately conclusive way, that was the thing that capped it for me, that I had to do something separately to protect the credibility of the investigation, which meant both the FBI and the Justice Department,” he said. Comey confessed that he followed Lynch’s advice, admitting that he could have resisted more. “I just said this isn’t a hill worth dying on and so I just said, ‘O.

","In a year of floors falling away under one’s feet (such as the assumption that nearly all Americans demand a minimal level of civility in public life) the Corey Lewandowski story represents one more gob smack. That Donald Trump stands by the belligerent Lewandowski tells us more of what we already knew about Trump, and also hints at the coward beneath the blowhard. First, the battery. The campaign manager  —   not a volunteer, not even a hired security guard  —   but the    campaign manager, nearly shoved reporter Michelle Fields to the ground and inflicted bruises on her arm. When she protested, there was no apology. Instead, the campaign at first suggested that there was a mistake: Lewandowski mistook Fields (who worked at the time for the   Breitbart. com) for a member of the mainstream media. Oh, so that makes shoving ok? But the campaign quickly reverted to outright lies. Hope Hicks, a Trump campaign spokesman, said that Fields’ account was “entirely false. . . . I did not witness any encounter . . . not a single camera or reporter of more than 100 in attendance captured the alleged incident. ” Trump himself offered that “maybe she made it up. ” Never mind. In the   Trump zone, facts are optional. “You are totally delusional,” Lewandowski said of Fields. “I never touched you. As a matter of fact, I have never even met you. ” Trumpkins disdain eyewitnesses, audio recordings, and videotape. You have your truth, as our friends on the left would say, and I have mine. Not even Bill Clinton was so brazen. RELATED: On Donald Trump and the   Thugs Who Do His Bidding, Any number of   commentators have advised Michelle Fields to get over it, put on her “big boy pants,” and otherwise to suck it up. Really? What about the big boy who’s running for president? Why is he so scared? Perhaps Trump’s fondness for Lewandowski is not in spite of his henchman’s willingness to get physical but because of it. Share article on FacebookshareTweet Trump seems more than usually frightened of protesters. To be sure, every candidate gets serious threats, and doubtless Trump has received some. But his threshold for feeling vulnerable seems unusually low. Before a rally in Iowa, he was told that some protesters might throw tomatoes at him. He was sufficiently alarmed to tell the crowd: “If you see somebody getting ready to throw a tomato, knock the crap out of them. ” For tomatoes. Nor has he been shy about calling down violence even on those who merely attempted to disrupt his speeches (which, I hasten to add, they have no right to do) but which in no way justifies mob violence. RELATED: If Donald Trump Were Eight, His Behavior Might Be Endearing, On another occasion, Lewandowski waded into the crowd and grabbed a protester by the collar. Trump approved of this maneuver too, explaining (if that’s the right word) to CNN’s Anderson Cooper that the man’s sign contained very bad words. Non sequitur. The Trump campaign has changed its story several times about Michelle Fields. The latest, on CNN Tuesday night, featured Trump justifying Lewandowki’s manhandling of Fields because she approached the TV star armed with a pen “which is very dangerous. ” Tomatoes, Bics, is there no end to the threats against Trump? More Donald Trump A Question Needing an AnswerIs Immigration to the U. S. an Entitlement? You gotta have heart, c. Donald Trump avoided the draft by claiming bone spurs in his heels  —   which somehow didn’t keep him off the ski slopes. Yet he had the gall to disparage the heroism of John McCain. His only real exposure to danger, his “personal Vietnam” he says, was sleeping around and risking STDs in the 1970s. Trump is a physically large man with the courage of a mouse. Like many cowards, he loves tough talk, but he prefers to issue threats from the comfort of his private jet and to let bullyboys such as Lewandowski actually get their hands dirty. Purely as a matter of national hygiene, Lewandowski should be fired. But more importantly, so should his boss. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,148

A report from a Gulf outlet in 2011 suggested Kuwait had banned issuing visas to several   nations, but the article did not name any sources and the government appears to have never officially confirmed such a measure.  Neither representatives at the Kuwaiti embassy in the United States, nor the country’s United Nations mission returned requests for comment on Saturday. Pakistan ambassador to Kuwait Ghulam Dastagir also told Pakistani television station Geo News the latest reports were “baseless. ”  The original Al Bawaba story cited only “Kuwaiti sources” who spoke to “local media,” but it was picked up by a number of other outlets including Breitbart News, Infowars, and Sputnik. That   website has since corrected its story, noting “the following news article proved to be untrue. ” Trump’s error went viral on Saturday after being posted to Twitter by Toronto Star reporter Daniel Dale. The White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment, but the president on Saturday posted a tweet again criticizing the New York Times for “FAKE NEWS. ”  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,149

# UCLA STATS 199 - Independent Directed Research
## Political Document Topic distribution using Latent Direchlet Allocation

This repository contains the code and data for my Spring 2018 STATS 199 class with Professor Miles Chen. This project concerns the distribution of topics - e.g. immigration or healthcare - between different online publications, and what this indicates about them.

I will be using the principle of Latent Direchlet Allocation (LDA) to let the topics naturally emerge from the data.

More to come!
